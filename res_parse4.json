The tower is based on the ancient and smaller Tower of the Winds in Athens, Greece, built c.100\u201350BC by Andronicus of Cyrrhus for the purpose of measuring time. It is of octagonal stone construction, with eight relief images of Greek mythological wind gods at the top of each side of the tower, carved by John Bacon the Elder in 1792\u20134. The tower was completed by James Wyatt in 1794. On the top are Atlas and Hercules supporting a globe in white, also by John Bacon. The reliefs of the signs of the zodiac above the windows on the first floor are made of Coade stone by J. C. F. Rossi. Inside the tower, there are three main rooms on top of each other. The Tower of the Winds is situated in prominent view just to the north of the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter (ROQ), an area for Oxford University departments including the Blavatnik School of Government, and south of Observatory Street, named after its former use as an observatory. To the south is the Mathematical Institute building of the University, juxtaposing the new 21st-century architecture of that building with the old 17th-century style of the observatory.

{"Category": "Cloudburst", "Subject": "Cloudburst_(Whitacre)", "abstract": {"value": "Cloudburst is one of Eric Whitacre's most famous compositions. Whitacre wrote the piece in 1992 (age 22) for eight-part choir, with piano and percussion accompaniment. The text was adapted from Octavio Paz's poem El C\u00e1ntaro Roto (The Broken Water-Jug). The first section is a cappella, notable for its dissonant tone clusters. Whitacre notates long, sustained notes with text to be spoken at random by each individual singer. Following the opening section is a baritone solo, which is then followed by the development of a new a cappella theme. This section continues into a spoken, arrhythmic incantatory solo with background. In the section titled \"The Cloudburst\", handbells (which are directed to be hidden from the audience) play a written two bars, and then play at random as the choir crescendos into an aleatoric section, which is signaled by a loud clap of \"thunder\". During this time, the choir begins claps, snaps, and thigh smacks in order to imitate the sound of rain. A thunder sheet, bass drum, handbells, suspended cymbal, wind chimes, and piano contribute to the effect of a thunderstorm. The storm gradually builds then fades, and the ending of the piece mirrors the beginning section, with the choir arpeggiating as the piano voices block chords. \"Cloudburst\" was the title feature of an album by Stephen Layton's chamber choir Polyphony. The album included other works by Whitacre and was nominated for the 2007 Grammy Award in best Choral Performance. A concert band version, commissioned for the Indiana All-State Band, was released by Whitacre in 2001.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1992_compositions", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Choral_compositions", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Concert_band_pieces", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Compositions_by_Eric_Whitacre"], "label": {"value": "Cloudburst (Whitacre)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudburst_(Whitacre)?oldid=707317162", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Whitacre_Cloudburst"]}

The Flood are driven by a desire to infect any sentient life they encounter, and are depicted as such a threat that the ancient Forerunners were forced to kill themselves and all other sentient life nearly 100,000 years ago in an effort to starve the Flood to death. The Flood's design and fiction was spearheaded by Bungie artist Robert McLees, who utilized unused concepts from the earlier Bungie game Marathon 2. The ringworld Halo was stripped of many of its large creatures to make the Flood's appearance more startling. Bungie environment artist Vic DeLeon spent six months of pre-production time refining the Flood's fleshy aesthetic and designing the organic interiors of Flood-infested space ships for Halo 3. The player's discovery of the Flood in Halo: Combat Evolved is a major plot twist, and was one of the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release. The Flood's return in Halo 2 and Halo 3 was less enthusiastically praised. Reaction to the Flood has varied over the years; while some found the Flood too derivative and a clich\u00e9 element of science fiction, some others ranked them among the greatest villains of all time.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Undead_characters_in_video_games", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Extraterrestrial_characters_in_video_games", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Halo_factions", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mutant_characters_in_video_games", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Fictional_extraterrestrial_life_forms", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Fictional_parasites_and_parasitoids", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Video_game_characters_introduced_in_2001", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Fictional_superorganisms", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Video_game_species_and_races"], "label": {"value": "Flood (Halo)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_(Halo)?oldid=729568644", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Flood_(Halo)"]}

{"Category": "Flood", "Subject": "Flooded_engine", "abstract": {"value": "A flooded engine is an internal combustion engine that has been fed an excessively rich air-fuel mixture that cannot be ignited. This is caused by the mixture exceeding the upper explosive limit for the particular fuel. An engine in this condition will not start until the excessively rich mixture has been cleared. It is also possible for an engine to stall from a running state due to this condition. Engine flooding was a common problem with carbureted cars, but newer fuel-injected ones are immune to the problem when operating within normal tolerances. Flooding usually occurs during starting, especially under cold conditions or because the accelerator has been pumped. It can also occur during hot starting; high temperatures may cause fuel in the carburetor float chamber to evaporate into the inlet manifold, causing the air/fuel mixture to exceed the upper explosive limit. High temperature fuel may also result in a vapor lock, which is unrelated to flooding but has a similar symptom. A severe form of engine flooding occurs when excessive liquid fuel enters the combustion chamber. This reduces the dead volume of the combustion chamber and thus places a heavy load on the starter motor, such that it fails to turn the engine. Damage (due to excessive compression and even dilution of the lubricating oil with fuel) can also occur. This condition is known as the engine \"flooding out.\" Liquids inside an internal combustion engine are extremely detrimental because of the incompressibility of liquids. Although not the most common cause, a severely flooded engine could result in a hydrolock. A hydrolock occurs when a liquid fills a combustion chamber to the point that it is impossible to turn the crankshaft without a catastrophic failure of the engine or one of its vital components. The conventional remedy for a flooded carbureted engine is to steadily hold the throttle full open (full power position) while continuing to crank the engine. This permits the maximum flow of air through the engine, flushing the overly rich fuel mixture out of the exhaust. If the exhaust system is hot enough to autoignite, an after-fire may result; this can be seen as a flame discharging through the exhaust system. On a fuel-injected engine, ignoring the throttle (no fuel) while starting permits electronic logic systems to produce the correct fuel mixture, often based on exhaust gases. Some fuel injection computers interpret 'pumping' the throttle to indicate a flooded engine, and alter the fuel-air mixture accordingly. In a carbureted engine equipped with an accelerator pump (which advances fuel flow to match air ingestion under rapid throttle acceleration), 'pumping' the throttle will force excess fuel into the engine, further flooding it. In worst cases, the excess fuel can foul spark plugs, sometimes necessitating their cleaning or replacement before the engine will start. This is most likely to occur on a carbureted engine in cold weather, after a running engine has been shut off briefly before being restarted. Doing so can cause the choke to configure the mixture for a cold engine start, despite higher actual temperatures, resulting in an overly rich mixture and flooded engine.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Engine_problems"], "label": {"value": "Flooded engine", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooded_engine?oldid=715405964", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}
{"Category": "Flood", "Subject": "Halo:_The_Flood", "abstract": {"value": "Halo: The Flood is a military science fiction novel by William C. Dietz, based on the Halo series of video games and based specifically on the 2001 video game Halo: Combat Evolved, the first game in the series. The book was released in April 2003 and is the second Halo novel. Closely depicting the events of the game, The Flood begins with the escape of a human ship Pillar of Autumn from enemy aliens known as the Covenant. When the Pillar of Autumn unexpectedly discovers a massive artifact known as \"Halo\", the humans must square off against the Covenant and a second terrifying force in a desperate attempt to uncover Halo's secrets and stay alive. Though the book roughly follows the same events of the Xbox game, featuring identical dialogue, Dietz also describes events not seen by the game's protagonist, the super-soldier Master Chief. After the success of the first Halo novel, Halo: The Fall of Reach, publisher Del Rey and Halo publisher Microsoft signed a deal for new books based on Xbox games, including another entry in the Halo series. Del Ray approached author Dietz to write the next book. Dietz incorporated his first-hand experience in the military for the additional scenes of The Flood not found in the game. Upon release, Halo: The Flood cracked the Publishers Weekly Top Ten Bestsellers List for Paperbacks, but critical reception to the novel was less positive than Eric Nylund's Fall of Reach or other Halo novels. The repetitive fight scenes and dramatically different characterization of the protagonist compared to Nylund's work were seen as major flaws, and Dietz's style of writing was alternatively praised and lambasted. The next Halo novel, Halo: First Strike, would serve to bridge the gap between Combat Evolved and its sequel, Halo 2.

Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court decision upholding, by a 5\u20133 margin, the antitrust exemption first granted to Major League Baseball (MLB) in Federal Baseball Club v. National League. It arose from a challenge by St. Louis Cardinals' outfielder Curt Flood when he refused to be traded to the Philadelphia Phillies after the 1969 season. He sought injunctive relief from the reserve clause, which prevented him from negotiating with another team for a year after his contract expired. Named as initial respondents were baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, MLB and all of its then-24 member clubs. Although the Court ruled in baseball's favor 5\u20133, it admitted the original grounds for the antitrust exemption were tenuous at best, that baseball was indeed interstate commerce for purposes of the act and the exemption was an \"anomaly\" it had explicitly refused to extend to other professional sports or entertainment. That admission set in motion events which ultimately led to an arbitrator's ruling nullifying the reserve clause and opening the door for free agency in baseball and other sports. The opinion has been criticized in several ways. It is seen by some as an overly strict and reflexive reliance on the legal doctrine of stare decisis that made an earlier mistake \"uncorrectable\". Even the text of the decision itself, mainly a seven-page introductory encomium to the game and its history by Justice Harry Blackmun that included a lengthy listing of baseball greats, came in for criticism. Some of the other justices, and Court observers, felt it was inappropriate for a judicial opinion. At the time of his later retirement and death, Blackmun would be remembered for it as much as Roe v.

Flooding was invented by psychologist Thomas Stampfl in 1967. It is still used in behavior therapy today. Flooding is a psychotherapeutic method for overcoming phobias. This is a faster (yet less efficient and more traumatic) method of ridding fears when compared with systematic desensitization. In order to demonstrate the irrationality of the fear, a psychologist would put a person in a situation where they would face their phobia at its worst. Under controlled conditions and using psychologically-proven relaxation techniques, the subject attempts to replace their fear with relaxation. The experience can often be traumatic for a person, but may be necessary if the phobia is causing them significant life disturbances. The advantage to flooding is that it is quick and usually effective. There is, however, a possibility that a fear may spontaneously recur. This can be made less likely with systematic desensitization, another form of a classical condition procedure for the elimination of phobias.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Anxiety_disorder_treatment", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Behavior_therapy", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Behaviorism"], "label": {"value": "Flooding (psychology)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_(psychology)?oldid=687824789", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flooding_(therapy)", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flooding_psychology", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flooding_(psychology", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flooding_therapy", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radical_exposure_therapy"]}

One motivation for this is television marketing, especially in sports such as gridiron football which rely on TV rights money to finance the sport. Some sports grounds which do not have permanent floodlights installed may make use of portable temporary ones instead. Many larger floodlights (see bottom picture) will have gantries for bulb changing and maintenance. These will usually be able to accommodate one or two maintenance workers.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Floodlights.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Stadiums", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Light_fixtures"], "label": {"value": "Floodlight", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floodlight?oldid=741723615", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floodlight_(disambiguation)", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flood_lights", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flood-light", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flood-lights", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floodlit", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flood-lit", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flood_light", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floodlighting", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floodlights", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flood_lighting", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flood-lighting", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flood_lit", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floodlights_(sport)"]}

{"Category": "Flood", "Subject": "MAC_flooding", "abstract": {"value": "In computer networking, MAC flooding is a technique employed to compromise the security of network switches. Switches maintain a MAC Table that maps individual MAC addresses on the network to the physical ports on the switch. This allows the switch to direct data out of the physical port where the recipient is located, as opposed to indiscriminately broadcasting the data out of all ports as a hub does. The advantage of this method is that data is bridged exclusively to the network segment containing the computer that the data is specifically destined for. In a typical MAC flooding attack, a switch is fed many Ethernet frames, each containing different source MAC addresses, by the attacker. The intention is to consume the limited memory set aside in the switch to store the MAC address table. The effect of this attack may vary across implementations, however the desired effect (by the attacker) is to force legitimate MAC addresses out of the MAC address table, causing significant quantities of incoming frames to be flooded out on all ports. It is from this flooding behavior that the MAC flooding attack gets its name. After launching a successful MAC flooding attack, a malicious user could then use a packet analyzer to capture sensitive data being transmitted between other computers, which would not be accessible were the switch operating normally. The attacker may also follow up with an ARP spoofing attack which will allow them to retain access to privileged data after switches recover from the initial MAC flooding attack.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ethernet", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Computer_network_security"], "label": {"value": "MAC flooding", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_flooding?oldid=710441384", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mac_flooding", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Failopen_mode"]}

The album was a debut for Daniel Lanois as a rock music producer; he would later (often in partnership with Brian Eno) produce for artists as diverse as U2, Bob Dylan, and Dashboard Confessional. Daniel's sister Jocelyne was a member of the band, playing bass and singing backing vocals on this album. The cover image was taken by Muffins' guitarist Mark Gane from an apartment he was living in on Bloor Street in Toronto. It depicts the Bank of Montreal's headquarters, First Canadian Place over a building in poor repair. After being unavailable for over 20 years, this much sought-after album was finally re-released on CD in 2005 by EMI Canada and includes two bonus tracks that were not on the original release. The CD has been released with copy protection technology which may make it difficult to play in some players or rip for use on MP3 players.

{"Category": "Ice_age", "Subject": "Ice_Age_(band)", "abstract": {"value": "Ice Age was a progressive band from New York City, USA. Founded by guitarist Jimmy Pappas, vocalist/keyboardist Josh Pincus, drummer Hal Aponte and bassist Arron DiCesare, the band released their debut album in 1999, titled The Great Divide. Liberation followed in 2001, both on Magna Carta Records. Ice Age are influenced by pop/progressive bands such as Yes, Kansas and Rush, but also by more modern progressive metal bands like Queensr\u00ffche, and Dream Theater. In 2006, the band officially changed their name to Soulfractured. This was accompanied by an announced shift in the band's music - less overt progressive experimentation, with closer attention paid to melodic structure and songcraft. In this incarnation the band released the Soulfractured EP, made available through the band's websites. They had previously released the Little Bird EP as Ice Age. Shortly after the second EP's release, the group disbanded.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_progressive_metal_musical_groups"], "label": {"value": "Ice Age (band)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Age_(band)?oldid=738709764", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}
