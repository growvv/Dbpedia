The ring is an independent circulatory system of warm water which can persist for several months. The rest of this article will use the Gulf Stream by way of an example but these mesoscale eddies also form in most powerful ocean currents, such as the Kuroshio or Agulhas currents. Such rings can be detected using infrared satellites or sea height anomalies and are easily identifiable against the surrounding colder waters. These systems will drift west from their origin at the Gulf Stream until they break apart on the coastal shelf or are reabsorbed by the Gulf Stream. This type of system is theorized to have helped develop several hurricanes, most notably Hurricane Katrina, into significantly stronger storms due to the abundance of warmer ocean water reaching down to a significant depth. In addition, these eddies can damage offshore drilling equipment due to their currents. Warm core rings are also known for affecting wildlife, bringing warm-water creatures to unusual areas.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Warm_core_ring2.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Weather_events", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ocean_currents"], "label": {"value": "Warm core ring", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm_core_ring?oldid=728773926", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

Originating from a monsoon trough, Typhoon Thad was first classified on August 15, 1981 and was upgraded into a tropical storm the next day. Meanwhile, Thad moved north and northeast and attained typhoon intensity midday on August 18. The next day, the storm reached its peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h). On August 22, Thad accelerated northward, striking eastern Japan the next day just before weakening to a tropical storm. After passing through the country, the cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August 23. Thirty-one persons perished in Japan due to the typhoon and 82 others were hurt. Thad flooded 22,433 houses and demolished 112 others. Roughly 27,000 people were left homeless because of Thad. Moreover, 111,500 homeowners were without power during the height of the storm.

{"Category": "Climate_change", "Subject": "Loss_and_damage", "abstract": {"value": "The term Loss and damage denotes impacts of climate-related stressors that occur despite efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climatic changes. Loss and damage can result from sudden-onset events (climate disasters, such as cyclones) as well as slow-onset processes (such as sea level rise). Loss and damage can occur in human systems (such as livelihoods) as well as natural systems (such as biodiversity), though the emphasis in research and policy is on human impacts. Within the realm of loss and damage to human systems, a distinction is made between economic losses and non-economic losses. The main difference between the two is that non-economic losses involve things that are not commonly traded in markets. At the 18th Conference of the Parties meeting of the UNFCCC in 2012 in Doha, Qatar, it took 36 hours of negotiation between 195 nations to arrive at a plan to address loss and damage associated with adverse effects of climate change particularly in countries most vulnerable to climate change. A new website was launched at the conference by the Loss and Damage Vulnerable Countries Initiative. It described its aim as being \"the first dedicated site for news, resources and opinion on the issue of loss and damage associated with the adverse impacts of climate change\". Examples of types of loss and damage include farmers who can no longer grow crops to eat, or grass to feed cattle, because their soil has become too salty, and fishermen who have lost their livelihoods because rivers have dried up. In popular press, and in statements by some parties in the climate negotiations, the terms loss and damage is often associated with liability and compensation. This explains why the topic raises heated debates, and tends to widen the divide between developed countries, which are historically responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions, and developing countries that are more vulnerable to impacts of climate change. For vulnerable countries, loss and damage is most of all about recognizing that past and current efforts to avoid dangerous climate change, and that there are limits and constraints to adaptation. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has developed a work programme on loss and damage which aims to find ways to address the issue in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. On 12\u201314 September 2013, it held a meeting in Fiji to consider how best to address loss and damage from 'slow-onset events'. These are impacts of climate change that occur over time, such as sea-level rise, rather than in a single, destructive event. Bangladesh is already suffering from loss and damage resulting from sea-level rise, due to its flat terrain in the coastal region. At the 19th Conference of the Parties meeting of the UNFCCC in 2013 in Warsaw, Poland, the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts was established. At the 20th Conference of the Parties in Lima, Peru (2014), the work plan of the executive committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism was approved. The 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in 2013-2014 had no separate chapter on loss and damage, but WG2 Chapter 16 about adaptation limits and constraints, is very relevant for people interested in loss and damage. A qualitative data analysis (QDA) of what the IPCC 5th Assessment Report has to say about loss and damage surprisingly showed that the term was used much more often in statements about Annex 1 countries (e.g. US, Australia or European countries) than in text about non-Annex 1 countries (most countries in Africa, Asia Latin America and the Pacific), which tend to be more vulnerable to impacts of climate change. Whether or not the IPCC 6th Assessment Report will have a chapter on loss and damage has not yet been decided.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Climate_change"], "label": {"value": "Loss and damage", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_and_damage?oldid=692748642", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}
{"Category": "Climate_change", "Subject": "Greenhouse_gas_emissions_accounting", "abstract": {"value": "Greenhouse gas emissions accounting is a method of calculating the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted by a region in a given time-scale. A National Emissions Inventory (NEI) measuring a country\u2019s GHG emissions in a year is required by the UNFCCC to provide a benchmark for the country\u2019s emission reductions, and subsequently to evaluate international climate policies such as the Kyoto protocol (although the original has now expired, extensions have been agreed) as well as regional climate policies such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). There are two conflicting ways of measuring GHG emissions: production-based (sometimes referred to as territorial-based) or consumption-based. Production-based emissions take place \u201cwithin national territory and offshore areas over which the country has jurisdiction\u201d. Consumption-based emissions encompass those emissions from domestic final consumption and those caused by the production of its imports. This means the importing country takes responsibility for emissions related to production of the exporting country\u2019s exports. By these definitions production-based emissions include exports but exclude imports and emissions embodied in international trade, whereas consumption-based emissions refer to the reverse (Table 1). Which technique is applied by policymakers is fundamental as each can generate a very different NEI. Different NEIs would result in a country\u2019s choosing different optimal mitigation activities, the wrong choice based on wrong information being potentially damaging. The application of production-based emissions accounting is currently favoured in policy terms, although much of the literature favours consumption-based accounting. The former method is criticised in the literature principally for its inability to allocate emissions embodied in international trade/transportation and the potential for carbon leakage.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Climate_change", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Greenhouse_gas_inventories"], "label": {"value": "Greenhouse gas emissions accounting", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions_accounting?oldid=697570599", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

Already by 1994 the legal debates about respective regulation regimes on climate change, ozone depletion and air pollution were being dubbed \"monumental\" and a combined synopsis provided. There are some parallels between atmospheric chemistry and anthropogenic emissions in the discussions which have taken place and the regulatory attempts which have been made. Most important is that the gases causing both problems have long lifetimes after emission to the atmosphere, thus causing problems which are difficult to reverse. However, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol that amended it are seen as success stories, while the Kyoto Protocol on anthropogenic climate change has largely failed. Currently efforts are being undertaken to assess the reasons and to use synergies, for example with regard to data reporting and policy design and further exchanging of information.

The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault\u2019s genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government (Malette, 2009). Begun in the mid-1990s by a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies. Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how government agencies, in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct \u201cThe Environment.\u201d This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government\u2019s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State. Ecogovernmentality is part of the broader area of political ecology. It can be situated within the ongoing debates over how to balance concern with socio-natural relationships with attention to the actual environmental impact of specific interactions. The term is most useful to authors like Bryant, Watts and Peet who argue for the importance of a phenomenology of nature that builds from post-structuralist concerns with knowledge, power and discourse. In addition, it is of particular use to geographers because of its ability to link place based socio-environmental phenomena with the non-place based influences of both national and international systems of governance.

{"Category": "Climate_change", "Subject": "Years_of_Living_Dangerously", "abstract": {"value": "Years of Living Dangerously is an American documentary television series focusing on global warming. The first season, of nine weekly episodes, premiered in the US on April 13, 2014, on Showtime. It won an Emmy Award as Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series. The second season, consisting of eight episodes, is expected to air on the National Geographic Channel, beginning on October 30, 2016, with broader international distribution than the first season. Executive producers include James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robert Palumbo, and series creators Joel Bach and David Gelber (formerly of 60 Minutes). Joseph Romm and Heidi Cullen are the chief science advisors. The weekly episodes feature celebrity investigators with a history of environmental activism and well-known journalists with a background in environmental reportage. These \"correspondents\" travel the world and throughout the U.S. to interview experts and ordinary people affected by, and seeking solutions to, the effects of global warming. They act as proxies for the audience, asking questions to find out people's opinions and to discover the scientific evidence. The final episode of season 1 featured an interview of President Barack Obama. Executive producers for season 1 were Cameron, Schwarzenegger, clean energy investor and environmental activist Daniel Abbasi, Jerry Weintraub, Bach and Gelber. Season 2 is expected to explore the effects of rising sea levels, historic droughts and the rapidly increasing extinction rate of species, but also to \"focus much more ... on solutions that individuals, communities, companies and even governments can use to address worldwide climate change\", including cheaper solar and wind energy, advancing battery technology and electric cars. Returning hosts for season 2 include Schwarzenegger, Ian Somerhalder, America Ferrera, Thomas Friedman and Don Cheadle, and newcomers David Letterman, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Jack Black, Cameron, Joshua Jackson, Aasif Mandvi, Cecily Strong, Sigourney Weaver, Bradley Whitford, Nikki Reed and Ty Burrell. Schwarzenegger reflected on how the series tries to make the issue of climate change resonate with the public: \"I think the environmental movement only can be successful if we are simple and clear and make it a human story. We will tell human stories in this project. The scientists would never get the kind of attention that someone in show business gets.\" Cameron elaborated: \"We didn\u2019t use our celebrities as talking head experts, because they\u2019re not climate experts. They were concerned, intelligent, curious citizens who were out to find answers. They were functioning as journalists.\" Newsweek said that the celebrity reporters \"lend sparks to an issue that sends most viewers for the exits\".", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Arnold_Schwarzenegger.JPG?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_documentary_television_series", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Nature_educational_television_series", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2014_American_television_series_debuts", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Climate_change", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Documentary_television_series", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Showtime_(TV_network)_original_programs", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2010s_American_television_series"], "label": {"value": "Years of Living Dangerously", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Living_Dangerously?oldid=744514857", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

This is now thought to be unlikely. However, there is stronger evidence that runaway methane clathrate breakdown may have caused drastic alteration of the ocean environment (such as ocean acidification and ocean stratification) and of the atmosphere of earth on a number of occasions in the past, over timescales of tens of thousands of years.

Where the atmosphere or an extensive ocean is able to convect heat polewards, the poles will be warmer and equatorial regions cooler than their local net radiation balances would predict. In the extreme, the planet Venus is thought to have experienced a very large increase in greenhouse effect over its lifetime, so much so that its poles have warmed sufficiently to render its surface temperature effectively isothermal (no difference between poles and equator).

{"Category": "Climate_change", "Subject": "Abrupt_climate_change", "abstract": {"value": "An abrupt climate change occurs when the climate system is forced to transition to a new climate state at a rate that is determined by the climate system energy-balance, and which is more rapid than the rate of change of the external forcing. Past events include the end of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, Younger Dryas, Dansgaard-Oeschger events, Heinrich events and possibly also the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum. The term is also used within the context of global warming to describe sudden climate change that is detectable over the time-scale of a human lifetime. One proposed reason for the observed abrupt climate change is that feedback loops within the climate system both enhance small perturbations and cause a variety of stable states. Timescales of events described as 'abrupt' may vary dramatically. Changes recorded in the climate of Greenland at the end of the Younger Dryas, as measured by ice-cores, imply a sudden warming of +10 \u00b0C (+18 \u00b0F) within a timescale of a few years. Other abrupt changes are the +4 \u00b0C (+7.2 \u00b0F) on Greenland 11,270 years ago or the abrupt +6 \u00b0C (11 \u00b0F) warming 22,000 years ago on Antarctica. By contrast, the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum may have initiated anywhere between a few decades and several thousand years.

{"Category": "Climate_change", "Subject": "Climate_change_adaptation", "abstract": {"value": "This article has not been updated to include results of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Adaptation is a response to global warming and climate change, that seeks to reduce the vulnerability of social and biological systems to relatively sudden change and thus offset the effects of global warming. Even if emissions are stabilized relatively soon, global warming and its effects will last many years, and adaptation will be necessary to the resulting changes in climate. Adaptation is especially important in developing countries since those countries are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global warming. That is, the capacity and potential for humans to adapt (called adaptive capacity) is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt (Schneider et al., 2007). Furthermore, the degree of adaptation correlates to the situational focus on environmental issues. Therefore, adaptation requires the situational assessment of sensitivity and vulnerability to environmental impacts. Adaptive capacity is closely linked to social and economic development (IPCC, 2007). The economic costs of adaptation to climate change are likely to cost billions of dollars annually for the next several decades, though the amount of money needed is unknown. Donor countries promised an annual $100 billion by 2020 through the Green Climate Fund for developing countries to adapt to climate change. However, while the fund was set up during COP16 in Canc\u00fan, concrete pledges by developed countries have not been forthcoming. The adaptation challenge grows with the magnitude and the rate of climate change. Another policy response to climate change, known as climate change mitigation (Verbruggen, 2007) is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or enhance the removal of these gases from the atmosphere (through carbon sinks). Even the most effective reductions in emissions, however, would not prevent further climate change impacts, making the need for adaptation unavoidable (Klein et al., 2007). In a literature assessment, Klein et al. (2007) assessed options for adaptation. They concluded, with very high confidence, that in the absence of mitigation efforts, the effects of climate change would reach such a magnitude as to make adaptation impossible for some natural ecosystems. Others are concerned that climate adaptation programs might interfere with the existing development programs and thus lead to unintended consequences for vulnerable groups  For human systems, the economic and social costs of unmitigated climate change would be very high.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Climate_change"], "label": {"value": "Climate change adaptation", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_adaptation?oldid=738647523", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adapting_to_global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adaptation_to_global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adaptation_to_Global_Warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adaptation_to_climate_change", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Global_warming_adaptation", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Climate_adaptation"]}

Time Magazine wrote in 1991 that Skovmand, \"'while not exactly a household name,' had had 'more to do with the welfare of the world's five billion people than many heads of state.'\" Skovmand was born in Frederiksberg, Denmark. After serving in the Danish Army, Skovmand attended the University of Minnesota in the US as part of the Minnesota Agricultural Student Trainee international exchange program. He graduated in 1971 with a major in biological and physical sciences in agriculture, and then earned his masters in 1973 and doctorate in 1976 both in Plant Pathology from the University of Minnesota After completing his doctorate, he joined the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in El Bat\u00e1n, Mexico, where he studied older seed strains and genetic variation among widespread strains. He also worked with governments and farmers across the world to increase the use of the advanced crops being developed. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog in 2003. Continuing his work on preserving the genetic diversity among wheats, barleys, and oats, he was appointed the director of the Nordic Gene Bank, based in Alnarp, Sweden, in 2003, and founded the Svalbard International Seed Vault. The Seed Vault, also called the \"Doomsday Vault\", is supported by the Global Crop Diversity Trust and aims to preserve \"the raw material of agriculture\" to make it available for breeding and research even in the advent of disaster, war, or climate change. The Vault was scheduled to open in late 2008. Skovmand was opposed to patenting individual genes, describing it as \"like copyrighting each and every word in Hamlet, and saying no one can use any word used in Hamlet without paying the author\". He routinely released his catalogs of agricultural information on CDs, which he gave away for free, never attempting to patent the work. In his work with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, Skovmand set up collaborations with for-profit companies to develop improved strains of agricultural staples, with the proviso that patents not be used in developing nations. Skovmand had four children, two with his wife Eugenia, and two by a previous marriage. Skovmand fell ill in January 2007, and died February 6, 2007, at age 62 in K\u00e4vlinge, Sweden, from complications from a malignant brain tumour.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Bent_Skovmand,_direktor_for_Nordisk_Genbank_2004-2007.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Deaths_from_cancer_in_Sweden", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1945_births", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Conservationists", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Danish_botanists", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2007_deaths", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Danish_geneticists", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:University_of_Minnesota_alumni", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Open_content_activists", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Deaths_from_brain_tumor"], "label": {"value": "Bent Skovmand", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Skovmand?oldid=736889395", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

Climate change affects agriculture in a number of ways, including through changes in average temperatures, rainfall, and climate extremes (e.g., heat waves); changes in pests and diseases; changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-level ozone concentrations; changes in the nutritional quality of some foods; and changes in sea level. Climate change is already affecting agriculture, with effects unevenly distributed across the world. Future climate change will likely negatively affect crop production in low latitude countries, while effects in northern latitudes may be positive or negative. Climate change will probably increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups, such as the poor. Agriculture contributes to climate change by (1) anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and (2) by the conversion of non-agricultural land (e.g., forests) into agricultural land. Agriculture, forestry and land-use change contributed around 20 to 25% to global annual emissions in 2010. There are range of policies that can reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture, and to reduce GHG emissions from the agriculture sector.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Annual_greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_sector,_in_2010_(color)_png.png?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Climate_change", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Climate_change_and_agriculture"], "label": {"value": "Climate change and agriculture", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_and_agriculture?oldid=738913559", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Global_warming_and_agriculture", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Effects_of_global_warming_on_agriculture", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Effects_of_agriculture_on_climate_change", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impact_of_agriculture_on_climate_change", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impact_of_global_climate_change_on_agriculture", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impact_of_global_climate_changes_on_agriculture", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Climate_change_&_agriculture", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agriculture_and_climate_change"]}
{"Category": "Climate_change", "Subject": "Paleocene\u2013Eocene_Thermal_Maximum", "abstract": {"value": "The Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), alternatively \"Eocene thermal maximum 1\" (ETM1), and formerly known as the \"Initial Eocene\" or \"Late Paleocene Thermal Maximum\" was a time period with more than 8 \u00b0C warmer global average temperature than today. This climate event began at the time boundary between the Paleocene and Eocene geological epochs. The exact age and duration of the event is uncertain but it is estimated to have occurred around 55.5 million years ago. The associated period of massive carbon injection into the atmosphere has been estimated to have lasted no longer than 20,000 years. The entire warm period lasted for about 200,000 years. Global temperatures increased by 5\u20138 \u00b0C. The carbon dioxide was likely released in two pulses, the first lasting less than 2,000 years. Such a repeated carbon release is in line with current global warming. A main difference is that during the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum, the planet was essentially ice-free. The onset of the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum has been linked to an initial 5 \u00b0C temperature rise and to extreme changes in Earth's carbon cycle. The period is marked by a prominent negative excursion in carbon stable isotope (\u03b413C) records from around the globe; more specifically, there was a large decrease in 13C/12C ratio of marine and terrestrial carbonates and organic carbon. Stratigraphic sections of rock from this period reveal numerous other changes. Fossil records for many organisms show major turnovers. For example, in the marine realm, a mass extinction of benthic foraminifera, a global expansion of subtropical dinoflagellates, and an appearance of excursion, planktic foraminifera and calcareous nanofossils all occurred during the beginning stages of PETM. On land, modern mammal orders (including primates) suddenly appear in Europe and in North America. Sediment deposition changed significantly at many outcrops and in many drill cores spanning this time interval. At least since 1997, the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum has become a focal point of considerable geoscience research because it probably provides the best past analog by which to understand impacts of global climate warming and of massive carbon input to the ocean and atmosphere, including ocean acidification. Although it is now widely accepted that the PETM represents a \"case study\" for global warming and massive carbon input to Earth's surface, the cause, details and overall significance of the event remain perplexing.

{"Category": "Conservationists", "Subject": "Allan_Savory", "abstract": {"value": "Allan Redin Savory (born 15 September 1935) is a Rhodesian ecologist, farmer, soldier, exile, environmentalist, international consultant, and president and co-founder of The Savory Institute. He originated holistic management, a systems thinking approach to managing resources. Once a staunch opponent of livestock, Savory would come to favor using properly managed livestock, bunched and moving to mimic nature, as a means to heal the environment, stating \"only livestock can reverse desertification. There is no other known tool available to humans with which to address desertification that is contributing not only to climate change but also to much of the poverty, emigration, violence, etc. in the seriously affected regions of the world.\" \"Only livestock can save us.\" He believes grasslands hold the potential to sequester enough atmospheric carbon dioxide to reverse climate change. Praised by supporters as genius, prophet and visionary, his controversial ideas have sparked fierce opposition from academics, environmentalists, and vegans.

{"Category": "Conservationists", "Subject": "David_B._Wingate", "abstract": {"value": "David Balcombe Wingate OBE, born October 11, 1935, is an ornithologist, naturalist and conservationist. He was born in Bermuda. In 1951 he helped Robert Cushman Murphy and Louis L. Mowbray re-discover a bird species thought extinct since the 1620s, the Bermuda petrel or cahow. This spurred him on to study Zoology at Cornell University, returning to take on the challenge of saving the cahow in 1958. He went on to become the Conservation Officer for the Bermuda Government Parks Department from 1966 to his retirement in 2000. He was credited with rediscovering the black-capped petrel in Haiti in 1963. His lifelong efforts to bring back the cahow from near-extinction led him to undertake the holistic restoration of an entire barren island's pre-colonial ecology, in a project known as the Nonsuch Island 'Living museum', reintroducing several other species in the process. He has been honoured with a number of awards. These include the Queen's Honours (UK), the MBE and OBE; King's Honours (Netherlands), Ridder, Order of the Golden Ark; the United Nations' Global 500 Award and Dr.of Sci. Honoris causa, Clark University, Massachusetts. In 1991 he was awarded the Linnaean Society of New York's Eisenmann Medal. In 2007 he was nominated for the 2008 Indianapolis prize. In 2012, a biography was published about his life's work. He has three daughters. His eldest daughter, Janet, has written an award-winning educational autobiography about her father's Nonsuch project, which has been adopted by the Bermuda Education Ministry as a schoolbook.

{"Category": "Climate_change", "Subject": "Environmental_Assessment_Institute", "abstract": {"value": "The Environmental Assessment Institute (EAI) (Danish: Institut for Milj\u00f8vurdering \u2013 IMV) was an independent body under the Danish Ministry of the Environment. It was established in February 2002 by the Liberal/Conservative Danish Government with the task of making environmental and economic cost/benefit analyses. The EAI's first Director was political scientist Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg. The EAI was seen by some as a vehicle created for Lomborg, whose book The Skeptical Environmentalist argues that many perceived environmental problems are vastly exaggerated by environmental lobby and that policy responses based on such exaggerated claims are often misguided. The Government appointed Ole P. Kristensen, an ex-professor at the institute where Lomborg worked, as the first Director of the Board. His job was to find the director and the other board members. Lomborg was soon announced as the director. The EAI began operating on June 1, 2002. The EAI published a series of reports on environmental issues, from the value of a deposit/return system for drink cans to global warming. Most of them are in Danish. A report from October 2002 made an economic cost-benefit analysis of deposits on disposable bottles and cans. It concluded that it would be better to abandon the deposit system and to let the bottles and cans be burned together with other household garbage. However, it turned out afterwards that many of the Danish incineration plants operate at temperatures at which aluminum cans will not burn, but only melt, and that the cans would pose a great economic problem for them. A committee was formed in March 2003 to evaluate the reports issued by the EAI during the second half of 2002. This committee was composed of one Danish member and four experts from Sweden and Norway. The committee adjudged the first three reports published in 2002 as superficial attempts to focus attention on the EAI. The other reports were adjudged appealing to the public, but the committee was not confident in the conclusions of two reports and in general criticized the cost-benefit analyses. In November 2003, five out of the seven board members resigned on the same day. Three of them did so because of disagreement about the Institute's involvement in the Copenhagen Consensus project, the others did so because of lack of time and conflicts of interest. In mid-June 2004, there was some stir in the Danish printed media because it was revealed that criticism of Lomborg\u00b4s book from Danish climate experts had been repressed for years by the head of the EAI (Lomborg). Lomborg resigned as director on August 1, 2004. From July 1, 2007, the Environmental Assessment Institute was changed into a department of the Danish Economic Council, and thus no longer exists as a separate institute.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Government_departments_and_agencies_of_Denmark", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2007_disestablishments_in_Denmark", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Environment_of_Denmark", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2002_establishments_in_Denmark", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Climate_change"], "label": {"value": "Environmental Assessment Institute", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Assessment_Institute?oldid=687393007", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Institute_for_Environmental_Assessment", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Institut_for_Milj\u00f8vurdering", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Institut_for_Miljovurdering"]}

{"Category": "Conservationists", "Subject": "Conservation_finance", "abstract": {"value": "Governments finance various forms of conservation finance. One such method involves establishing debt-for-nature swaps that aid environmental sustainability efforts in developing nations. Originated in the 1980s, this concept allows for public and private interests to purchase debt from a developing country. Consequently, that nation's purchased debt is discharged in part or in full. The government then spends the money on domestic conservation projects. While developed nations participate in these transactions, private institutions purchase this debt as well. For example, commercial banks buy this debt and sell the portfolio at discounted prices to other investors or financial firms. Third-party organizations, particularly NGOs, participate in these swaps to secure currency or help develop governmental programs using the newly acquired funds. In 1987, Bolivia successfully implemented the first debt-for-nature swap. The Bolivian government sold $650,000 of its debt for $100,000. In exchange, Bolivia agreed to provide funding for sustainability efforts in Beni's wildlife reserve.

{"Category": "Climate_change", "Subject": "Attribution_of_recent_climate_change", "abstract": {"value": "Attribution of recent climate change is the effort to scientifically ascertain mechanisms responsible for recent climate changes on Earth, commonly known as 'global warming'. The effort has focused on changes observed during the period of instrumental temperature record, when records are most reliable; particularly in the last 50 years, when human activity has grown fastest and observations of the troposphere have become available. The dominant mechanisms (to which the IPCC attributes climate change) are anthropogenic, i.e., the result of human activity. They are: \n*  increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases \n*  global changes to land surface, such as deforestation \n*  increasing atmospheric concentrations of aerosols. There are also natural mechanisms for variation including climate oscillations, changes in solar activity, and volcanic activity. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is \"extremely likely\" that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951 and 2010. The IPCC defines \"extremely likely\" as indicating a probability of 95 to 100%, based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence. Multiple lines of evidence support attribution of recent climate change to human activities: \n*  A basic physical understanding of the climate system: greenhouse gas concentrations have increased and their warming properties are well-established. \n*  Historical estimates of past climate changes suggest that the recent changes in global surface temperature are unusual. \n*  Computer-based climate models are unable to replicate the observed warming unless human greenhouse gas emissions are included. \n*  Natural forces alone (such as solar and volcanic activity) cannot explain the observed warming. The IPCC's attribution of recent global warming to human activities is a view shared by most scientists, and is also supported by 196 other scientific organizations worldwide (see also: scientific opinion on climate change).", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Attribution_of_global_warming.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Climate_change", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Climate_change_science", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Environmental_issues_with_energy"], "label": {"value": "Attribution of recent climate change", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change?oldid=742308048", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Natural_global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attribution_of_the_global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Causes_of_global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthropogenic_global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Man-made_global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attribution_of_climate_change", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthropogenic_Global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attribution_of_global_warming", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Climate_Change_Caused_by_Human_Activities", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Climate_attribution", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cause_of_climate_change", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cause_of_global_warming"]}

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Nancy_(1982)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Nancy, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Weling, was a destructive typhoon that moved through Vietnam and the Philippines during October 1982. The typhoon originated from an area of convection and was first classified as a tropical cyclone on October 10. The system attained gale-force winds the next day, and slowly deepened thereafter. Although Nancy initially moved west, the system maintained a general westward course for much of its duration, striking Luzon on October 14 at peak intensity of 215 km/h (130 mph). It weakened to tropical storm strength overland, but re-intensified to typhoon intensity over the South China Sea. Nancy hit northern Vietnam on the October 18, and weakened almost immediately thereafter, before dissipating on October 20 inland over Vietnam. In the Philippines, damage was the worst in Cagayan and Isabela. In the former, 4,378 homes were destroyed while 2,250 houses were destroyed in the latter. Nationwide, 96 people were killed and 30 others were listed as missing. Additionally, 186 were injured. A total of 12,464 homes were destroyed while 34,111 others were damaged. Moreover, 301,431 persons were \"affected\" by the storm, or 51,532 families. Damage totaled to $56 million (1982 USD), including $18 million from infrastructure and $26 million from agriculture. While strking Vietnam, the typhoon killed 30 people. Around 72,000 homes were destroyed, leaving 125,000 people homeless. Throughout the country, 450,000 acres (182,110 ha) of rice were destroyed.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Nancy_Oct_14_1982_0601Z.png?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1982_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_the_Philippines"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Nancy (1982)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Nancy_(1982)?oldid=743294575", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Typhooon_Nancy_(1982)"]}

The 16th named storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, Sinlaku formed on August 27 northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands. After initially moving to the north, it began a generally westward motion that it maintained for the rest of its duration. Sinlaku strengthened into a typhoon and attained its peak winds on August 31. Over the next few days, it fluctuated slightly in intensity while moving over or near the Ryukyu Islands. On September 4, the typhoon's eye crossed over Okinawa. It dropped heavy rainfall and produced strong winds that left over 100,000 people without power. Damage on the island was estimated at $14.3 million. After affecting Okinawa, Sinlaku threatened northern Taiwan, which was previously affected by two deadly typhoons in the previous year. Officials enacted many preparations, although damage ended up being minimal on the island. Two people were killed on Taiwan, however. Sinlaku weakened slightly before making its final landfall in eastern China near Wenzhou on September 7. There, the storm produced a record wind gust of 204 km/h (127 mph), and just south of the city, high waves destroyed several piers and a large boat. High rainfall and winds from Sinlaku destroyed 58,000 houses, and large areas of crops were destroyed.

The storm tracked northwestward toward Taiwan, and on July 2 it attained its peak intensity with winds of 160 km/h (100 mph). Rammasun turned northward, passing east of Taiwan and China. In Taiwan, the outer rainbands dropped rainfall that alleviated drought conditions. In China, the rainfall occurred after previously wet conditions, resulting in additional flooding, although damage was less than expected; there was about $85 million in crop and fishery damage in one province. After affecting Taiwan and China, Rammasun began weakening due to an approaching trough, which turned the typhoon northeastward. It passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima and also produced strong winds in Okinawa. About 10,000 houses lost power on the island, and high surf killed two sailors. On the Japanese mainland, there was light crop damage and one serious injury. After weakening to a tropical storm, Rammasun passed just west of the South Korean island of Cheju-do, killing one person from high waves.

Subsequently, the typhoon weakened greatly while curving to the northeast, although it still passed near Okinawa with strong winds that left widespread power outages. Halong struck southeastern Japan, dropping heavy rainfall and producing strong winds that left $89.8 million (\u00a510.3 billion 2002 JPY) in damage.

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Abe_(1990)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Abe, known as Typhoon Heling in the Philippines, was the fourteenth named storm of 1990 Pacific typhoon season. Forming on August 23 from a tropical disturbance, the depression which would eventually develop into Typhoon Abe initially tracked in a steady west-northwestward direction. As a result of an intense monsoon surge, Abe's trajectory briefly changed to an eastward then northward path before returning to its original track. Abe only intensified by a small amount between 00:00 UTC August 24 and 06:00 UTC August 27 due to the disruptive effects of the surge, and on August 30, Abe peaked in intensity as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. After peaking in intensity, Abe crossed the Ryukyu Islands and the East China Sea, making landfall in China where it affected the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu before entering the Yellow Sea, crossing South Korea, and finally transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Typhoon Abe killed 108\u2013195 people after it caused flooding and landslides in the Philippines and Taiwan, ravaged coastal areas of China, and brought high waves to Japan. Abe, which is responsible for killing 108 in China, affected half of Zhejiang's land area and a fourth of its population, leaving thousands homeless and causing \u00a53.5 billion yuan (RMB, $741.5\u2013743 million USD) to be lost in damages. Additional damage and one fatality occurred in Okinawa Prefecture in Japan, where at least \u00a5890 million yen (JPY, $6 million USD) in damage was caused.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Abe_aug_30_1990_0545Z.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1990_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Japan", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_China", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Taiwan"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Abe (1990)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Abe_(1990)?oldid=744693636", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Typhoon_Heling_(1990)"]}

Etau made landfall on the Japanese island of Shikoku on August 8, and later moved across portions of Honshu and Hokkaido. After weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone became extratropical on August 9 and dissipated three days later. While passing northeast of the Philippines, the typhoon caused light damage in the archipelago. The eye crossed over Okinawa, where Etau left 166,800 people without power and caused 10 injuries. Near where Etau first struck Japan, Muroto reported a peak wind gust of 166 km/h (103 mph), at the time the third strongest on record there. The typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 683 mm (26.9 in). The combination of winds and rainfall caused landslides, particularly on Hokkaido.

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Higos_(2002)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Higos was considered the third strongest typhoon to affect Tokyo since World War II. The 21st named storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, Higos developed on September 25 east of the Northern Marianas Islands. It tracked west-northwestward for its first few days, steadily intensifying into a powerful typhoon by September 29. Higos subsequently weakened and turned to the north-northeast toward Japan, making landfall in that country's Kanagawa Prefecture on October 1. It weakened while crossing Honshu, and shortly after striking Hokkaid\u014d, Higos became extratropical on October 2. The remnants passed over Sakhalin and dissipated on October 4. Before striking Japan, Higos produced strong winds in the Northern Marianas Islands while passing to their north. These winds damaged the food supply on two islands. Later, Higos moved across Japan with wind gusts as strong as 161 km/h (100 mph), including record gusts at several locations. A total of 608,130 buildings in the country were left without power, and two people were electrocuted in the storm's aftermath. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 346 mm (13.6 in). The rains flooded houses across the country and caused mudslides.

Originating from a near-equatorial trough on October 26, the precursor depression to Keith slowly organized into a tropical storm. After two days of gradual strengthening, the storm underwent a period of rapid intensification on October 30 as winds increased to 195 km/h (120 mph). On November 1, the storm further intensified into a super typhoon and later attained peak winds of 285 km/h (180 mph). The following day, the powerful storm passed between Rota and Tinian in the Northern Mariana Islands. After fluctuating in strength over the following few days, a steady weakening trend established itself by November 5 as the typhoon accelerated towards the northeast. On October 8, Keith transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was last noted early the following day near the International Dateline. Despite Typhoon Keith's close passage to the islands of Rota and Tinian as a powerful storm, neither island received sustained winds over 160 km/h (105 mph). However, these winds resulted in significant damage across the island chain. More than 800 homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm and losses amounted to $15 million (1997 USD).

Forming from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April 9 well removed form any landmasses, Kujira quickly intensified in its early stages, and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis. Strengthening slowed afterwards, though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April 14. Intensification continued and late on April 15, Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg). Following peak intensity, Kujira would begin to track northwest and oscillate in strength, cresting an additional two times in intensity. On April 21, the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track erratically for several days east of Taiwan. However, on April 24, Kujira would resume a northward track and begin to weaken, and on April 24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on Kyushu. Following landfall Kujira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and continued to persist before these extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline towards the end of April 2003. Shortly after developing, Kujira caused two fatalities in Pohnpei in addition to minor agricultural and infrastructure damage; similar effects were felt in Guam. Several days later, the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and other precautionary measures in the Philippines after forecasts indicated the potential for strong winds and rain. However, effects on the island chain associated with the storm remained minimal. The typhoon also prompted warning products in Taiwan, making it the first April typhoon since 1978 to cause such a feat. Unlike in the Philippines, however, Kujira would bring significant rainfall to Taiwan. Effects from the typhoon were most significant in Japan, particularly in the Ryukyu Islands. Strong winds, rain, and waves caused US$230,000 (\u00a527.8 million) in agricultural damage on Ishigaki Island. One person was killed due to injuries resulting from the waves. In Kyushu, heavy rainfall, peaking at 196 mm (7.7 in) in \u014cita Prefecture, was reported.

It tracked westward, and fluctuated in intensity for several days. On March 24, Typhoon Nelson intensified into a typhoon, and entered an episode of rapid intensification. On March 25, Nelson reached its peak intensity of 115 km/h (70 mph), but thereafter moved ashore on the Philippines, where the storm weakened significantly. On March 27, the typhoon entered the South China Sea, and the next day, briefly re-intensified before resuming a weakening trend. Nelson dissipated on March 31. Affecting the nation less than a week after Tropical Storm Mamie did, Nelson was responsible for additional flooding across much of the Philippines. Fifty-six people were killed due to the typhoon, eight of whom perished due to drownings. Over 1,200 homes were destroyed. More than 165,000 people fled to shelters, including 83,000 that were displaced from their home. Thirty fishing boats and 23 ferries were destroyed due to the system. Damage amounted to $17.2 million (1982 USD).", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/NELSON_1982_mar_25_0603Z.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Disasters_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1982_Pacific_typhoon_season"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Nelson (1982)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Nelson_(1982)?oldid=739336856", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

Joan, concurrently with Typhoon Ivan to its west, also became the strongest typhoons at the same time in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The 25th named storm during the active 1997 Pacific typhoon season, Joan developed from the same trough as Typhoon Ivan on October 11. It moved northwestward and later to the west, undergoing explosive deepening to its peak intensity on October 15. One typhoon warning agency estimated that Joan was among the strongest storms on record in the basin, and that Ivan and Joan marked the first occurrence of simultaneous super typhoons. While near peak intensity, Joan passed between Anatahan and Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Later, the typhoon weakened and turned to the north and east, becoming extratropical on October 24. On Saipan, Typhoon Joan destroyed 37 houses and caused an island-wide power outage. Three people were injured due to boarding up their house during the storm. On nearby Anatahan, high winds caused $200,000 (1997 USD) worth of crop and property damage.

During the morning hours of July 24, the typhoon was estimated to have reached its peak intensity of 205 km/h (125 mph), but soon began to weaken due to interaction with land. By the time it moved ashore in southern China on July 25, Wayne had weakened considerably. After moving inland, Wayne weakened rapidly. The following day, Wayne was no longer a tropical cyclone. Typhoon Wayne became the second typhoon to strike the Philippines within nine days. Furthermore, 42 people lost their lives in flood waters while attempting to cross a temporary bridge. A total of 28 persons were hurt and 39 were rescued, and there were initially reports of up to 200 people missing. Although Wayne passed south of Taiwan, moderate flooding was reported due to rough seas.

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Vera_(1983)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Vera, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Bebeng, was a tropical cyclone that brought significant flooding to the Philippines in July 1983. The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on July 12 east of the Philippines. Although the depression was initially slow to organize, the system headed west-northwestward, strengthening to a tropical storm the following day and a typhoon on the July 14. Vera moved onshore early the next day as a minimal typhoon in the Philippines before weakening slightly over the islands. However, Vera managed to restrengthen over the South China Sea while accelerating, later attaining winds of 85 mph (135 km/h). After crossing Hainan while still at peak intensity and moving into the northern portion of the Gulf of Tonkin, Vera gradually weakened before moving ashore in northern Vietnam on July 18. By July 19, Vera had dissipated inland. Across the Philippines, Typhoon Vera killed 123 and left 60 missing and 45 hurt. Approximately 200,000 people were homeless. The typhoon destroyed 29,054 dwellings and \"badly\" damaged 5,558 others. A total of 76,346 homes were \"partially\" damaged. Moreover, 24,280 people sought shelter due to Vera. Around 80% of Manila's residents lost power. Many low-lying areas of Manila were underwater while strong winds damaged homes and trees. The province of Bataan sustained the worst damage from the storm and 10 nearby villages were destroyed. Throughout the province, 50 people perished, primarily due to drownings.

First noted southeast of Guam on July 31, development of this system was initially slow to occur; it was first classified on August 5, and was upgraded into a tropical storm the next day. Intensification was rapid as Abby slowly recurved northward on August 7 and 8. After reaching peak intensity with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) early on August 9, Abby slowly weakened, though the storm briefly re-intensified on August 11. By August 14, winds had diminished to 100 mph (160 km/h). Abby finally weakened back into a tropical storm on August 17 not long after making landfall in Japan. The following day, Abby completed the transition to an extratropical cyclone after moving through central Japan. However, meteorologists continued monitoring the storm for six more days. In the Philippines, heavy rainfall resulted in a landslide that crushed a house in Manila, killing three people. Two others drowned due to rough seas. Typhoon Abby also brought several consecutive days of rain to southern and central Japan, resulting in widespread damage. Commercial traffic by land, sea, and air was also paralyzed by the cyclone, stranding 25,900. Moreover, over 10,000 fishing boats took refuge in harbors. Around 3,400 homes were flooded and 24 homes were either damaged or destroyed. Additionally, 89 roads were also damaged. About a dozen people were injured during a flash flood that destroyed three houses. Three more dwellings were washed away when a river overflowed its banks. Nationwide, 27 people were hurt and two persons were killed.

Forming along the western end of the monsoon trough in the Philippine Sea, the system had organized into a tropical depression on September 16, and by that night a tropical storm. As a compact system, rapid intensification continued, with Ken becoming a typhoon on the evening of September 17 and a major typhoon on September 18. The cyclone up to this point had a history of progressing slowly west-northwest, but Ken eventually stalled on September 20 and became a larger cyclone. As a mid-latitude trough to its north deepened, Ken took off to the northeast towards Okinawa. Ken made landfall upon Shikoku early on September 25, and moved onward into the Sea of Japan where it evolved into an extratropical cyclone. Five people were killed while 18 others were hurt.

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Amy_(1951)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Amy was an intense and deadly tropical cyclone that struck areas of the central Philippines in December 1951. Impacting the archipelago during the 1951 eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok, Amy exacerbated the effects of the volcano, greatly increasing the number of resulting deaths. The fifteenth named storm and fourteenth typhoon within the western Pacific Ocean that year, Amy developed from an area of low pressure near the Kwajalein Atoll on December 3. Tracking in a general westward direction, the storm quickly intensified to reach typhoon intensity the next day. However, the typhoon's asymmetricity resulted in a fluctuation of intensity over the following few days. Afterwards, Amy intensified to reach its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.05 inHg) on December 8. Over the ensuing two days, Amy moved over several islands in the central Philippines before emerging in the South China Sea on December 11 as the equivalent of a minimal typhoon. Shortly after, the tropical cyclone executed a tight anticyclonic loop while oscillating in strength several times before eventually weakening and dissipating on December 17, just east of Vietnam. Amy was considered one of the worst typhoons to strike the Philippines on record. Making its initial landfall along with the concurrent eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin, the typhoon disrupted volcanic relief operations and forced the displacement of victims already displaced by the volcano. Cebu City suffered the worst impacts of Amy \u2013 most of the city's buildings were heavily damaged, and 29 people died in the city. Strong winds and rainfall in the city associated with Amy also set records which still remain unbroken today. Damage there was estimated at 560 million Philippine pesos. Along the east coast of Leyte, where Amy initially struck, ninety percent of homes were destroyed, and a large swath of coconut plantations were wiped out. In Panay, located on the western side of the Philippines, at least a thousand homes were destroyed in 41 towns. Overall, Amy caused $30 million in damage, and at least 556 fatalities, though the final death toll may have been as high as 991, making the typhoon one of the deadliest in modern Philippine history.

The storm originated as a tropical depression near Guam on August 25, 1981. Moving along a west-northwest to northwest track, the system gradually strengthened as deep convection organized around it. The depression was assigned the name Agnes on August 27 following the development of gale-force winds. Further intensification to typhoon-status occurred by August 29. Agnes attained its peak intensity on August 31 over the East China Sea as a Category 2-equivalent on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale with winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). Subsequent interaction with a mid-latitude trough induced an extratropical transition as the cyclone slowed and turned north. The system had lost most of its tropical characteristics by September 1, with the majority of convection sheared northeast over South Korea and Japan. Agnes later accelerated northeast and completed its transition on September 3. The remnants continued along this course, impacting northern Japan and the Kamchatka Peninsula before last being noted on September 6 near the International Dateline. Throughout the course of Agnes' existence, several countries were affected by torrential rains and typhoon-force winds. Hardest hit was South Korea where record-breaking rains triggered widespread flooding. More than 12,000 structures were damaged or destroyed by the storm and 191,000 acres (77,300 hectares) of farmland was inundated. A total of 113 people lost their lives in the country while damage reached $134 million. Taiwan saw similarly destructive rains which left 32 people dead of missing. A further 14 lives were lost in mainland China where coastal flooding from the typhoon's slow movement coincided with the spring tide, resulting in the greatest storm surge since 1949 along the Yangtze estuary and Hangzhou Bay.

Andy formed along the northern edge of the monsoon trough south of Guam on July 22, 1982. It became a tropical storm the next day, although this system was initially poorly organized. Andy moved steadily west during the first few days of its life. After looping south of Guam, the cyclone moved northwest and strengthened. Andy turned westward near the 18th parallel on July 25. The system became a strong typhoon for a prolonged period on July 27 and July 28 while attaining a peak intensity of 185 km/h (115 mph). However, the typhoon struck southern Taiwan on July 29. Continuing westward through the Formosa Strait, the storm made its final landfall in southern China on July 30 and dissipated inland two days later. During its formative stages, the typhoon brought high waves to Guam, resulting in one death. Twelve families were also left homeless. After passing near Taiwan, Andy brought strong winds, which resulted in 13 deaths. Government offices, schools and airports were closed. At least 60 fishing boats in harbors were badly damaged or wrecked due to strong winds. A total of 300 poer poles were brought down; consequently, nearly a quarter of Taiwan residents lost power at the height of the storm. After moving ashore in China, Andy brought heavy rains to nearby Hong Kong.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Andy_Jul_28_1982_0629Z.png?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Taiwan", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1982_Pacific_typhoon_season"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Andy (1982)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Andy_(1982)?oldid=684349662", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

Lee originated from an area of thunderstorm activity near the Truk Atoll towards the end of December. Following an increase in organization, the system was classified as a tropical cyclone on December 22. After becoming a tropical storm, Lee began to slowly strengthen, and attained typhoon status on December 24. While turning west towards the Philippines, Lee began to intensify more rapidly. It is estimated to have reached peak intensity the next day, with winds of 145 km/h (90 mph). At peak intensity, the storm moved ashore the central Philippines later on December 25. Lee emerged into the South China Sea the following day as a tropical storm. Initially, the storm maintained its intensity, but soon began to weaken due to increased wind shear. By December 28, all of the thunderstorm activity was removed from the center, and on December 29, Lee dissipated. However, the remnants of the cyclone was last noted a few hundred kilometers south of Hong Kong. Across the Philippines, Typhoon Lee killed 188 people.

However, after turning north and crossing the Shanghai Peninsula and the Yellow Sea, Mamie made a second landfall near Yantai as a tropical storm. After turning northwest and re-entering the Yellow Sea, Mamie moved ashore for the third and final time near Dairen. On August 21, Mamie dissipated inland over northeastern China. Due to both Mamie and Nelson, widespread flooding was reported across much of northern China, with 19 rivers overflowing. The typhoon forced around 1,000 factories to temporarily close, and toppled approximately 6.5 million trees. Moreover, about 8,000 homes were flooded and 120,000 houses received damage Nearly 1 million people were directly affected by the typhoon. The typhoon killed more than 120,000 animals and sank more than 200 boats. Overall, 17 fatalities occurred and 165 were injured. Losses totaled $172 million (1985 USD).", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Mamie_Aug_18_1985_0614Z.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1985_disasters_in_China", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_China", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1985_Pacific_typhoon_season"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Mamie (1985)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Mamie_(1985)?oldid=743294532", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

It was the deadliest and costliest storm of the season. The tenth typhoon of the 1988 Pacific typhoon season, Ruby formed from an area of low pressure east of the Philippines on October 20. It intensified to a 230 km/h (145 mph) typhoon while approaching central Luzon. It hit the island on the October 24, and rapidly weakened to a minimal typhoon over the island. Ruby, with its disrupted circulation, remained weak over the South China Sea, and land interaction with Vietnam caused it to dissipate on October 28. Ruby caused over 300 fatalities, with widespread flooding and damage over its track. Ruby brought heavy rains and a 3.7 meter (12 feet) storm surge to Guam and the Marianas Islands. On Luzon, the storm's 220 km/h (140 mph) winds caused tremendous damage to the town of Siniloan. In the Polillo Islands, east of Manila, Ruby spawned rare tornadoes that leveled homes. In the northern part of the Philippines, many fishing boats were wrecked by 30\u201340 foot waves, and 32 more people drowned. Damage in the Philippines totaled 5.64 billion Philippine pesos (1989 pesos). The passenger ferry Do\u00f1a Marilyn was in the Visayan Sea when the storm struck the vessel. The ferry was not designed for deep water, and the open decks let water into the interior of the ship. The storm caused the ferry to pitch to the starboard until one of the decks was below the water, causing the ship to fill up rapidly. The passengers and crew tried to save the ship, but to no avail. The Do\u00f1a Marilyn sank stern first, taking 389 people with it. Only 147 people survived by clinging to life rafts. Typhoon Ruby was the twelfth most intense tropical cyclone in terms of wind speed to affect the Bicol Region of the nation.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Typhoon_Ruby_23_oct_1988_2236Z.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1988_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1988_disasters_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_the_Philippines"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Ruby (1988)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Ruby_(1988)?oldid=741258918", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Typhoon_Unsang(1988)", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Typhoon_Ruby_(Pacific_1988)"]}

It was the only super typhoon of that year. The natural phenomenon reached \"super typhoon\" status on September 22, when it grew to comprise winds containing a force of 260 kilometres per hour (160 mph). Super Typhoon Bart claimed at least two lives on the island of Okinawa and brought over 710 millimetres (28 in) of rain to the island. Kadena Air Base was badly damaged by the typhoon, with over $5 million of damage sustained by the base. Heavy flooding and landslides led to a death toll of 30 and over 1,000 injuries in Japan. Over 800,000 homes lost power, whilst 80 000 were damaged in the aftermath of the storm. The worst damage occurred in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, where 16 people died and over 45,000 homes were damaged.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Super_Typhoon_Bart.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1999_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Japan", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Bart (1999)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Bart_(1999)?oldid=714053493", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Typhoon_Bart_(Pacific_1999)"]}

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Hester_(1971)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Hester of October 1971 was regarded as one of the most destructive storms to strike Vietnam since 1944. Developing as a tropical depression on October 18 near Palau, Hester gradually intensified as it moved westward towards the Philippines. Across the Philippines, Hester was responsible for six deaths and \u20b15 million in damage. After passing over Mindanao and the Visayas as a tropical storm between October 20 and 21, the storm intensified into a typhoon before striking Palawan. Once over the South China Sea, Hester further strengthened and ultimately attained peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). On October 23, the storm made landfall near Hu\u1ebf, South Vietnam. Once onshore, Hester rapidly weakened and dissipated on October 24 over Laos. The most significant impact from Typhoon Hester was felt in South Vietnam, where winds in excess of 155 km/h (100 mph) caused extensive damage to several United States Army bases. The hardest hit base was in Chu Lai where three Americans were killed. At least 75 percent of the structures in the base sustained damage and 123 aircraft were damaged or destroyed. Newspaper reports indicated that 100 Vietnamese lost their lives due to the storm, including 33 following a plane crash near Quy Nh\u01a1n.

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Cyclone_Forrest", "abstract": {"value": "Cyclone Forrest, also referred to as Typhoon Forrest, was a powerful tropical cyclone that prompted the evacuation of 600,000 people in Bangladesh in late November 1992. Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Caroline Islands on November 9, Forrest was classified as a tropical depression three days later over the South China Sea. Tracking generally west, the system steadily organized into a tropical storm, passing Vietnam to the south, before striking Thailand along the Malay Peninsula on November 15. Once over the Bay of Bengal, Forrest turned northward on November 17 and significantly intensified. It reached its peak intensity on November 20 as a Category 4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 230 km/h (145 mph). Hostile environmental conditions soon affected the cyclone as it turned abruptly east-northeastward. Forrest made landfall in northwestern Myanmar as a weakening system on November 21 before dissipating early the next day. The majority of deaths associated with Forrest resulted from a plane crash on November 14 in Vietnam which killed 30 of the 31 occupants. In Thailand, the system produced significant storm surge, damaged or destroyed 1,700 homes, and killed two people. Agricultural losses in the hardest hit areas were estimated at \u0e3f800 million (US$32 million). On November 20, as Forrest reached its peak intensity, fears arose across Bangladesh that a repeat of the catastrophic April 1991 cyclone would take place. As a result, mass evacuation plans were enacted across coastal areas of the country, with plans to relocate up to 2 million people. But the storm abruptly turned eastward, and the successful evacuation of 600,000 residents spared countless lives. Only two deaths were recorded and overall damage was light, though half of all homes on St. Martin's Island were damaged.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cyclone_Forrest_on_November_20,_1992.png?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Tropical_cyclones_in_Bangladesh", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Thailand", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Western_Pacific_tropical_storms", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1992_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1992_North_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1992_in_Bangladesh", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Vietnam", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Tropical_cyclones_in_Myanmar", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Extremely_severe_cyclonic_storms"], "label": {"value": "Cyclone Forrest", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Forrest?oldid=741892016", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclone_Forrest_(1992)"]}

The 20th named storm of the 1991 Pacific typhoon season, Mireille formed on September 13 from the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands. It moved westward for several days as a small system, steered by the subtropical ridge to the north. The storm rapidly intensified to typhoon status on September 16, and several days later passed north of Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Mireille intensified further after deleterious effects from a nearby tropical storm subsided. On September 22, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated maximum 1\u2011minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), and on the next day, the official Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated 10\u2011minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). The typhoon weakened slightly while turning northward, passing just east of Miyako-jima and later to the west of Okinawa. On September 27, Mireille made landfall near Nagasaki in southwestern Japan with winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), the strongest since Typhoon Nancy in 1961. The storm accelerated to the northeast through the Sea of Japan, moving over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September 28. The remnants of Mireille continued to the east, passing through the Aleutian Islands of Alaska on October 1. The typhoon first threatened Guam, although it passed well to the north of the island, bringing damaging winds to northern Saipan. The first part of Japan affected was Miyako-jima, where heavy rainfall and high winds damaged crops. Mireille lashed Okinawa with strong waves, while strong winds up to 189 km/h (118 mph) damaged power lines and trees. The typhoon ultimately caused damage in 41 of 47 prefectures of Japan, with overall damage estimated at $10 billion (USD), making it the costliest typhoon on record as of 2014. Mireille produced record wind gusts at 26 locations, with a peak gust of 218 km/h (136 mph) in western Honshu. The winds caused record power outages across Japan that affected 7.36 million people, or about 13% of total customers. Mireille also left extensive crop damage totaling $3 billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000 tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. The storm damaged over 670,000 houses, of which 1,058 were destroyed, and another 22,965 were flooded. Throughout Japan, Mireille killed 66 people and injured another 2,862 people, including ten deaths on a capsized freighter. Elsewhere, the typhoon killed two people in South Korea, and its remnants brought strong winds to Alaska.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Typhoon_Mireille_22_sept_1991_2236Z.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Japan", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1991_in_Japan", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1991_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Retired_Pacific_typhoons"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Mireille", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Mireille?oldid=738115745", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Typhoon_Mireille_(1991)"]}

A small tropical cyclone, Yunya rapidly developed from a tropical disturbance near East Samar on June 11. By June 13 the storm had reached typhoon status as it moved west-northwest near the Philippines. Yunya attained its peak intensity the following day with estimated winds of 195 km/h (120 mph); however, strong wind shear soon impacted the typhoon and caused it to rapidly decay. The storm struck southern Luzon early on June 15 as a minimal typhoon before moving over the South China Sea later that day. After turning north and weakening to a tropical depression, the system brushed the southern tip of Taiwan on June 16 before dissipating the following day. Across the Philippines, Yunya produced heavy rains that triggered significant flooding. Hundreds of homes and several bridges were washed away by swollen rivers. Four people were killed as a direct result of the storm and three others were listed as missing. Although the storm itself caused significant damage, the worst effects were related to the system's heavy rains mixing with volcanic ash from Pinatubo. The combined effects of both natural disasters created numerous large lahars that killed 250\u2013300 people.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Fig11.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1991_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1991_disasters_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1991_natural_disasters"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Yunya (1991)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Yunya_(1991)?oldid=737825051", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Nepartak_(2003)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Nepartak, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Weng, was a modest tropical cyclone that struck the central Philippines and the southern China island of Hainan in November 2003. Forming as a tropical depression on November 11 between Yap and Guam, the system moved westward and slowly intensified. It received the name Nepartak midday on November 12 from the Japan Meteorological Agency, becoming the 20th named storm of the 2003 Pacific typhoon season. On November 13, Napartak struck Samar in the Philippines and bisected the island chain. Up to four million people lost power, and transportation ground to a halt; over 5,000 individuals became stranded on ships forced to stay in port during the tropical storm. It was reported that 13 individuals lost their lives to the storm in the Philippines. After entering the open waters of the South China Sea, Nepartak continued to intensify and turned more toward the northwest. It attained its peak intensity on November 16, with maximum 10\u2011minute sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and 1-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). After weakening slightly, the storm found a weakness in the easterly steering currents and bore north, reintensifying slightly and directly striking southwestern Hainan. There, heavy rainfall and strong winds destroyed crops, livestock, and hundreds of homes, leaving $197 million (2003 USD) in damage. The storm rapidly deteriorated in the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated as it neared mainland China.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Typhoon_Nepartak_17_nov_2003_0320Z.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2003_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_China", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2003_disasters_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2003_disasters_in_China"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Nepartak (2003)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Nepartak_(2003)?oldid=741893204", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Nina_(1987)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Nina, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Sisang, was the most intense typhoon to strike the Philippines since Typhoon Irma in 1981. Typhoon Nina originated from an area of convection near the Marshall Islands in mid-November 1987. It gradually became better organized, and on November 19, was first classified as a tropical cyclone. Moving west-northwest, Nina attained tropical storm intensity that evening. Late on November 20, Nina passed through the Chuuk Lagoon. After a brief pause in intensification, Nina intensified into a typhoon on November 22. Two days later, the typhoon intensified suddenly, before attaining its peak 10 minute intensity of 165 km/h (105 mph). During the afternoon of November 25, Nina moved ashore in southern Luzon at the same intensity. It gradually weakened over land, before entering the South China Sea and turning to the north. By November 30, Nina dissipated. Across the Chuuk Lagoon, four people were killed and damage ranged from $30\u2013$40 million (1987 USD). In the capital of Weno, 85% of dwellings and 50% of government buildings were damaged. Throughout the atoll, at least 1,000 people were rendered homeless, approximately 1,000 houses were damaged, and 39 injuries were reported. While crossing the Philippines, Nina brought extensive damage to the northern portion of the island group. The town of Matnog sustained the worst damage from the typhoon, where 287 people died. Sixty-one lives were lost in the nearby city of Verla, where 98% of all structures were either damaged or destroyed. Four hundred people died, 80% of all crops were destroyed, and 90% of all homes were either damaged or destroyed in the Sorsogon province. Nearby, in the Albay province, 73 people were killed. Throughout both the Albay and Sorsogon provinces, four-fifths of all schools and half of all public infrastructure were destroyed. Elsewhere, in Boac, 80% of homes lost their roofs. In Bacacay, 18 of the village's 200 homes were destroyed. However, the capital city of Manila avoided the brunt of the typhoon. Throughout the Philippines, approximately 114,000 people sought shelter, approximately 90,000 houses were destroyed, leaving more than 150,000 homeless. Nationwide, damage from the storm totaled $54.5 million and 808 people perished.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Typhoon_Nina_25_nov_1987_0702Z.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Retired_Philippine_typhoon_names", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1987_disasters_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1987_Pacific_typhoon_season"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Nina (1987)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Nina_(1987)?oldid=738204820", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supertyphoon_Nina"]}

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Bess_(1982)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Bess struck Japan in early August 1982, resulting in severe damage. The eleventh tropical storm, sixth typhoon, and first super typhoon of the 1982 Pacific typhoon season, the system first developed on July 21. Two days later, it was upgraded into a tropical storm, and subsequently began to intensify while tracking northwest. Bess attained typhoon intensity on July 24, before it briefly turned southwest. After turning north-northwest, the typhoon entered a period of rapid intensification and late on July 28 reached peak winds of 230 km/h (145 mph). After turning north, Bess began to weaken as it encountered less favorable conditions. On August 1, Bess was downgraded into a tropical storm. Shortly after that, the storm struck southeastern Japan, and on August 2 merged with a low pressure area atop of the Sea of Japan. Typhoon Bess cut threw a 400 km (250 mi) swath that included the most populated portion of Japan. Bess caused \u00a5591.6 billion (US$2.32 billion) in damage and 95 casualties. Furthermore, 119 others were hurt. Four people were killed due to landslides, while two other individuals were buried alive. A series of landslides stranded about 2,000 people, including 1,500 children. In all, 43 dwellings were destroyed and 17,000 homes were flooded. A total of 59 roads were impassable, 42 bridges were destroyed and 785 landslides occurred. Fifteen railway lines were disrupted due to torrential rainfall. In addition, 2,857 acres of farmland were flooded, 101 bridges were washed out and roads were damaged at more than 1,000 locations. Two boats sunk. Roughly 25,000 people were displaced. Following the storm, 2,100 policeman and firefighters dug through debris to rescue people.

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Mike", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Mike, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ruping, was the second strongest typhoon, behind Typhoon Flo, and the deadliest typhoon of the 1990 Pacific typhoon season as it crossed the Philippines in November. Forming from an area of persistent convection over the Caroline Islands, Mike headed westward. Early on the 8th, the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm Mike near Yap. Mike became a typhoon early on November 9, the 18th of the season. On November 10, the typhoon rapidly intensified, reaching peak winds of 165 mph later that day. In a 48-hour period, the typhoon deepened 99 millibars to a pressure of 915 mbar (27.0 inHg). Mike weakened shortly before land interaction and slammed over the eastern Philippines as a 140 mph (230 km/h) typhoon on November 12. Mike reached a secondary peak of 95 mph (153 km/h) winds on November 14. However, interaction with Vietnam again weakened it to a minimal typhoon. Vertical shear increased, weakening Mike to a tropical storm on the 16th. Early the next day, the storm passed over western Hainan Island, and degraded to a tropical depression that night.

In the Philippines, Dan left hundreds of thousands homeless and killed 58 people. Power outages were extensive in the Manila region.

One person was killed in a landslide and another drowned in a flood. Seven more people were killed by Typhoon Oscar throughout the country.

Yancy was the sixth typhoon of the annual typhoon season and sixth tropical cyclone overall to impact Japan that year. Developing out of an area of disturbed weather in the open northwest Pacific on August 29, 1993, the precursor to Yancy tracked westward and quickly intensified to reach tropical storm strength on August 30. Just two days later, the tropical storm reached typhoon intensity as it recurved towards the northeast. A period of rapid intensification followed, allowing Yancy to quickly reach super typhoon intensity. The strong tropical cyclone reached peak intensity on September 2 with maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). The following day Yancy made its first landfall on I\u014djima at nearly the same strength; over the course of the day the typhoon would make three subsequent landfalls on Japanese islands. Land interaction forced the tropical cyclone to weaken, and after its final landfall on Hiroshima Prefecture, Yancy weakened below typhoon intensity. After emerging into the Sea of Japan, Yancy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone; these remnants persisted as they meandered in the sea before dissipating completely on September 7.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Yancy_Sept_2_1993_0701Z.png?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1993_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Japan"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Yancy (1993)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Yancy_(1993)?oldid=741258966", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Typhoon_Yancy_(Tasing)"]}

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Muifa_(2004)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Muifa, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Unding, was a strong typhoon during the 2004 Pacific typhoon season. The name Muifa is taken from the ume blossom. The first of four consecutive tropical cyclones to strike the Philippines, a tropical disturbance became Tropical Depression 29W on November 14 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Muifa in the early of the 15th when centered east-southeast of Manila, the Philippines. Muifa turned back onto a west-northwest heading and intensified. It reached typhoon intensity on the 17th just prior to beginning a two-day clockwise loop. Late on the 18th, Muifa's intensity peaked at 130 mph (115 knots), still to the east of the Philippines. Unding, as PAGASA named it, made landfall very late on the 19th near Naga City with maximum winds of 80 mph (70 knots). The storm briefly lost typhoon strength for a day until it regained typhoon intensity in the South China Sea on the 21st. Muifa held onto typhoon status until late on the 23rd when its weakened to a tropical storm once more. By early on the 26th, a weakening Tropical Depression Muifa was located 250 nm south of Bangkok, Thailand. Later that day Muifa turned northward into an environment of increased wind shear and dissipated 120 nautical miles (220 km) south-southwest of Bangkok. The highest 24-hour rainfall amount from the Philippines was 246.4 mm at Catanduanes between midday the 15th and 16th.

Typhoon Ike caused extreme wind and flooding damage when it crossed the Philippines, resulting in 1492 fatalities, one of the Philippines' worst natural disaster in modern times, and its worst typhoon since Amy struck the archipelago in 1951.

Extensive crop damage was experienced in southern China, with Ike becoming the most significant tropical cyclone to strike Guangxi since 1954. Total damage was reportedly US$111 million (1984 dollars). The name Ike was retired after this season.

Typhoon Soudelor, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Egay, was a powerful typhoon that underwent rapid deepening east of Taiwan in the 2003 Pacific typhoon season. It was the sixth named storm by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) of the season, as well as the third typhoon. It formed on June 12 from a disturbance in the monsoon trough, located east of the Philippines. The system moved generally to the northwest after its genesis, gradually intensifying into a tropical storm. While offshore the Philippines, Soudelor dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless. The storm caused $2.46 million in damage, and 12 deaths. After affecting the Philippines, Soudelor moved into an area of low wind shear and with favorable outflow. It became a typhoon on June 17, and quickly developed an eye while rapidly intensifying. The storm struck the Japanese island of Iriomote-jima, where wind gusts reached 204 km/h (127 mph). It also affected Taiwan, where floods covered highways and caused mudslides. Early on June 18, Soudelor reached peak 10\u2011minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). Subsequently, an increase in shear and the passage of a trough weakened the typhoon and caused it to turn to the northeast. Soudelor weakened to a tropical storm on June 19, and subsequently it passed between Japan and South Korea. It became an extratropical cyclone that day, dissipating on June 24. In Japan, the storm caused widespread power outages, although damage was minimal, and there were 21 injuries. In South Korea, there was $12.1 million in damage and two deaths.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Typhoon_Soudelor_18_jun_2003_0225Z.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Japan", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_South_Korea", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Taiwan", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2003_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2003_disasters_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2003_in_Taiwan"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Soudelor (2003)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Soudelor_(2003)?oldid=738813017", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Cobra", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Cobra, also known as the Typhoon of 1944 or Halsey's Typhoon (named after Admiral William 'Bull' Halsey), was the United States Navy designation for a tropical cyclone that struck the United States Pacific Fleet in December 1944 during World War II. Task Force 38 (TF 38) had been operating about 300 mi (260 nmi; 480 km) east of Luzon in the Philippine Sea, conducting air raids against Japanese airfields in the Philippines. The fleet was attempting to refuel its ships, especially the lighter destroyers, which had small fuel tanks. As the weather worsened it became increasingly difficult to refuel, and the attempts had to be discontinued. Despite warning signs of worsening conditions, the ships remained in their stations. Worse, the information given to Halsey about the location and direction of the typhoon was inaccurate. On December 17, Halsey unwittingly sailed Third Fleet into the heart of the typhoon. Because of 100 mph (87 kn; 45 m/s; 160 km/h) winds, very high seas and torrential rain, three destroyers capsized and sank, and 790 lives were lost. Nine other warships were damaged, and over 100 aircraft were wrecked or washed overboard; the aircraft carrier Monterey was forced to battle a serious fire that was caused by a plane hitting a bulkhead. USS Tabberer\u2014a small John C. Butler-class destroyer escort\u2014lost her mast and radio antennas. Though damaged and unable to radio for help, the ship remained on the scene to recover 55 of the 93 total sailors who were rescued. Captain Henry Lee Plage earned the Legion of Merit, while the entire crew earned the Navy's Unit Commendation Ribbon, which was presented to them by Halsey. In the words of Admiral Chester Nimitz, the typhoon's impact \"represented a more crippling blow to the Third Fleet than it might be expected to suffer in anything less than a major action\". The events surrounding Typhoon Cobra were similar to those the Japanese navy itself faced some nine years earlier in what they termed the \"Fourth Fleet Incident.\" This typhoon also led to the establishment of weather infrastructure of the US Navy, which eventually became the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. A typhoon plays an important role in the novel The Caine Mutiny, which is thought to be based on the author's own experience surviving Typhoon Cobra.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Typhoon_Cobra,_18_December_1944_east_of_Luzon.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Pacific_Ocean_theatre_of_World_War_II", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Unknown-strength_tropical_cyclones", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1944_meteorology", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1944_in_Oceania", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1944_in_Asia", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1940\u201349_Pacific_typhoon_seasons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1944_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1944_natural_disasters"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Cobra", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Cobra?oldid=743000868", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Typhoon_Cobra_(1944)", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halsey's_Typhoon", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Typhoon_of_1944", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Typhoon_Halsey"]}

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Ophelia", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Ophelia was a long-lived and powerful tropical cyclone that had devastating impacts on the small atoll of Ulithi in the Caroline Islands. Forming as a tropical depression on November 21, 1960 near Enewetak Atoll, the incipient cyclone struggled to develop. Moving haphazardly along an s-shaped track over the western Pacific Ocean, it degenerated into a disturbance two days later. By November 27, the system reorganized and was classified a tropical depression for a second time well to the southeast of Guam. Moving slowly west-southwest, it steadily intensified into a tropical storm later that day and further into a typhoon on November 29 as it gained a steady westward track. The following day, the eye of Ophelia passed directly over Ulithi atoll with winds estimated at 230 km/h (145 mph). Turning gradually to the north, the typhoon attained peak winds of 250 km/h (155 mph) on December 1. Maintaining strength as a powerful system for several days, the storm remained over open waters. By December 4, it began to weaken as upper-level winds became unfavorable and forced the cyclone to move northeast. Passing Japan well to the southeast that day, its large circulation brought increased winds to the Tokyo area and heavy rain and snow to parts of the nation. Ophelia soon underwent an extratropical transition as it raced over the open Pacific, completing this structural change by December 6. Its remnants later crossed the International Dateline and dissipated over the Gulf of Alaska on December 10. Ophelia devastated much of Ulithi during its passage, damaging or destroying most structures and killing two people. Agriculture across the area was decimated and geographic changes to coastlines were noted. In Ophelia's wake, dramatic societal changes in the Ulithian culture arose. Traditional values were abandoned in favor of more western ones, with younger individuals attaining a notable increase in power. The local King was disposed of shortly after the storm and a total change in authority took place.

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Karen", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Karen was the most powerful tropical cyclone to strike the island of Guam, and has been regarded as one of the most destructive events in the island's history. It was first identified as a tropical disturbance on November 6, 1962, well to the southeast of Truk. Over the following two days, the system tracked generally northward and quickly intensified. Karen became a tropical storm late on November 7, and within two days it explosively intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale. Turning westward, the typhoon maintained its intensity and struck Guam with winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) on November 11. Once clear of the island, it strengthened slightly and reached its peak intensity on November 13 with winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a barometric pressure of 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg). The storm then gradually turned northward as it weakened, brushing the Ryukyu Islands on November 15, before moving east-northeastward over the open waters of the Pacific. Karen continued to weaken and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 17 before losing its identity the following day between Alaska and Hawaii. Karen devastated Guam with wind gusts estimated up to 280 km/h (185 mph). Ninety-five percent of homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving at least 45,000 people homeless. Communication and utilities were crippled, forcing officials to set up water distribution centers to prevent disease. Total losses on the island amounted to $250 million. Despite the severity of the damage, only 11 people were killed. In the wake of the storm, a massive relief operation evacuated thousands to California, Hawaii, and Wake Island. Thousands more were sheltered in public buildings, and later tent villages, for many months. More than $60 million in relief funds were sent to Guam over the following years to aid in rehabilitation.

For other storms of the same name, see Tropical Storm Dot (disambiguation).) Typhoon Dot, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Saling, was the strongest storm of the 1985 season. Dot originated from a small area of thunderstorm activity in early to mid October. The system was first classified on October 11, and steadily intensified over the next few days. Dot attained typhoon strength on October 15, and subsequently entered a period of explosive deepening, which was not anticipated by forecasters. The next day the intensification rate slowed, but that evening, Dot attained its maximum intensify. A steady weakening trend began on October 17, though the system maintained typhoon intensity through the passage of the Philippines. After entering the South China Sea late on October 18, Dot briefly re-intensified, only to weaken as it approached Vietnam. On October 21, Dot struck Vietnam while still a typhoon, but dissipated the next day over the high terrain of the nation. Although damage across the Philippines was less than initially expected, the typhoon lashed the nation with heavy rains. Nueva suffered the worst effects from Dot. There, 500,000 acres (200,000 ha) of crops and 90% of all buildings were damaged. In Cabanatuan, 2,500 homes and 90% of structures were destroyed. Overall, 42 towns were flooded, forcing a total of 125,000 people to flee their homes, 35,000 of which were homeless. Furthermore, 52,933 houses were leveled while an additional 200,450 were damaged. Nationwide, 24 were hurt. While tracking through the South China Sea, Dot passed through Hainan Island. There, two casualties occurred while 34 others suffered injuries.

Developing out of a poorly organized system on October 8 to the east of the Philippines, Bess featured two centers of circulation. Initially the southern low was monitored; however, a low to the north soon became the dominant center. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the storm gradually intensified before striking northern Luzon as a minimal typhoon on October 11. Temporary weakening took place due to interaction with land. After moving back over water the following morning, Bess regained typhoon intensity. This was short-lived though, as conditions surrounding the cyclone soon caused it to weaken. Now moving due west, the weakening storm eventually struck Hainan Island as a tropical storm on October 12 before diminishing to a tropical depression. The depression briefly moved back over water before dissipating in northern Vietnam on October 14. Bess produced heavy rains throughout the Philippines, especially in Luzon where 782.3 mm (30.80 in) was measured in Baguio. These rains triggered extensive flooding and landslides that killed 26 people and left 3 others missing. Many homes were destroyed and damage amounted to $9.2 million (1974 USD). On October 12, a reconnaissance plane, with a crew of six, investigating the periphery of the storm went missing. It is presumed that the entire crew was lost when the aircraft crashed off the coast of Luzon.

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Sarah_(1989)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Sarah, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Openg, was a powerful typhoon that caused extensive damage along an erratic path across the Western Pacific in September 1989. Originating from a disturbance within a monsoon trough in early September, Sarah was first classified as a tropical depression near the Mariana Islands on September 5. Moving quickly westward, the depression soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Sarah. On September 8, the storm abruptly turned southward and temporarily attained typhoon status. Following a series of interactions with secondary areas of low pressure, the storm turned northward the following day. By September 11, Sarah entered a region favoring development and underwent a period of explosive intensification. At the end of this phase, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 4\u2013equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. The typhoon subsequently weakened rapidly and made two landfalls in Taiwan by September 12. After moving over the Taiwan Strait, Sarah made its final landfall in Eastern China on September 13 before dissipating the following day. While the typhoon meandered near the Philippines, it brought several days of heavy rain to much of Luzon, triggering extensive flash flooding. At least 44 people perished across the country and another 200,000 were left homeless. Striking Taiwan as a strong typhoon, Sarah caused widespread wind damage that left approximately 840,000 residents without power. Excessive rainfall associated with the storm triggered flooding that washed away highways and inundated about 40,500 hectares (100,000 acres) of farmland. Throughout the island, Sarah was responsible for 19 fatalities and at least $171 million USD (4.38 billion New Taiwan dollars) in damage. Four deaths also took place on the Got\u014d Islands.

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Betty_(1987)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Betty, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Herming, was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines in August 1987. The seventh typhoon and second super typhoon of the active typhoon season, it formed from the monsoon trough that spawned a tropical cyclone on August 8 while around positioned well to the east of the Philippines. It drifted northwestward, becoming a tropical storm on August 9 and a typhoon on August 10. Betty turned westward, where it rapidly intensified before attaining peak intensity on August 11. The next day, Typhoon Betty made landfall in the central Philippines. Betty weakened rapidly over the country, but restrengthened somewhat over the South China Sea. Land interaction weakened Betty slightly before it hit central Vietnam on August 16. The next day, Betty dissipated. Across the Philippines, Typhoon Betty brought widespread flooding, which resulted in severe destruction. Damage added up to $100 million (1987 USD). In the Maguindanao and Albay provinces alone, 10,000 people were evacuated and 1,000 were homeless. However, the capital city of Manila avoided any serious damage. Nationwide, around 200,000 people were reportedly homeless, 18,000 of winch were from Marinduque and another 11,400 resided on Mindoro Island. In the former, 4,000 dwellings sustained damage, and all of the banana crop there was lost. In all, 25,518 homes received damage. Roughly 400,000 people were directly affected by the storm. Overall, 85 people were killed and 324 others were wounded. After striking the Philippines, six people were killed by Betty in Vietnam. Approximately 10,000 structures were damaged and 103 people were injured. Elsewhere, in northern Thailand, one person was killed and three others were hurt by the typhoon.

{"Category": "Typhoons", "Subject": "Typhoon_Judy_(1989)", "abstract": {"value": "Typhoon Judy of July 1989 was a strong tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage and loss of life in Japan, South Korea and the eastern Soviet Union. Originating from a monsoon trough on July 21, Judy began as a tropical depression west of the Northern Mariana Islands. Tracking west-northwest, the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Judy on July 23. By this time, the storm had turned due north. Two days later, Judy attained typhoon status as it began a gradual turn to the west-northwest. Late on July 25, the storm peaked with winds of 165 km/h (110 mph). Striking Kyushu on July 27, interaction with the island's mountainous terrain caused Judy to quickly weaken as it neared South Korea. The weakened storm struck the country west of Pusan the following day before losing its identity near the border with North Korea. The remnants of Judy were last noted over the Sea of Japan. In Japan, damaging winds from the typhoon left approximately 4 million people without power. Significant flooding in the country resulted in 11 deaths and $28.9 million in damage. In South Korea, heavy rains from the storm exacerbated ongoing floods, leading to at least 20 fatalities.

A powerful Category 5 super typhoon, Elsie formed out of a tropical disturbance on October 13, 1989, and initially moved relatively slowly in an area of weak steering currents. On October 15, the storm underwent a period of rapid intensification, attaining an intensity that corresponds to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. After taking a due west track towards the northern Philippines, the storm intensified further, becoming a Category 5 super typhoon hours before making landfall in Luzon. After moving inland, the typhoon rapidly weakened to a tropical storm. Once back over water in the South China Sea, wind shear prevented re-intensifcation. Elsie eventually made landfall in Vietnam on October 22 and dissipated the following day over Laos. In the Philippines, Elsie worsened the situation already left in the wakes of typhoons Angela and Dan. Although it was stronger than the previous two, Elsie caused far less damage due to the relatively sparse population in the area of landfall. During the storm's passage, 47 people were killed and another 363 were injured. Damages throughout the country amounted to $35.4 million and roughly 332,000 people were left homeless.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Elsie_oct_18_1989_0526Z.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1989_Pacific_typhoon_season", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1989_disasters_in_the_Philippines", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Vietnam", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_China", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Typhoons_in_Hong_Kong"], "label": {"value": "Typhoon Elsie (1989)", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Elsie_(1989)?oldid=741258678", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

Forming east of the Philippines in tandem with another system on September 4, the disturbance continued to intensify, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on September 6 and a typhoon on September 8 while tracking northwestward. On September 9, Judy attained its peak intensity, with winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). Thereafter, increased wind shear took a toll on the typhoon, as it turned northward on September 11 in the general direction of Japan under the influence of a mid-latitude cyclone. Judy passed over southeastern Japan on September 12; by this time, the typhoon had weakened considerably. Judy became an extratropical cyclone almost immediately thereafter. Across Japan, a total of 26 people were killed, eight others were rendered as missing, and 86 were injured. A total of 61,000 homes were flooded. Three boats sank and highways were cut in 956 locations. It is estimated that 1,100 landslides occurred during the passage of the cyclone. Downtown Tokyo sustained the worst of the damage, where 8,000 homes were flooded.

{"Category": "Droughts", "Subject": "Rainmaking", "abstract": {"value": "Rainmaking, also known as artificial precipitation or artificial rainfall, is the act of attempting to artificially induce or increase precipitation, usually to stave off drought. According to the clouds' different physical properties, this can be done using airplanes or rockets to sow to the clouds with catalysts such as dry ice, silver iodide and salt powder, to make clouds rain or increase precipitation, to remove or mitigate farmland drought, to increase reservoir irrigation water or water supply capacity, or to increase water levels for power generation. In the United States, rainmaking was attempted by traveling showmen. It was practiced in the old west, but may have reached a peak during the dust bowl drought of the American West and Midwest in the 1930s. The practice was depicted in the 1956 film The Rainmaker. Attempts to bring rain directly have waned with development of the science of meteorology, the advent of laws against fraud and increased communication technology, with some exceptions such as cloud seeding and forms of prayer including rain dances, which are still practiced today. Prayer for more rain is also a cross cultural practice in Christians and Muslims in areas where people keep \"traditional\" non-scriptural religions. In the Christian areas the Defteras (learned clerics of the Orthodox Christian Church) believed to have the wisdom to arrest the rain, to bring hail to farms of individuals who refuse to comply with religious rules as well as to bring more rains when the rainy season fell short of giving the usual amount of rain needed for growing cereals. The term is also used metaphorically to describe the process of bringing new clients into a professional practice, such as law, architecture, consulting, advertising, or investment banking\u2014in general, processes that bring money into a company.

Plants and animals living in arid or periodically arid environments such as temporary streams or ponds may face the challenge of desiccation, therefore physiological or behavioral adaptations to withstand these periods are necessary to ensure survival. In particular, insects occupy a wide range of ecologically diverse niches and, so, exhibit a variety of strategies to avoid desiccation.

Originally the term referred to the vast hinterlands of Asia and South America that Lusitanian explorers encountered. In Brazil it referred to backlands away from the Atlantic coastal regions where the Portuguese first settled in South America in the early sixteenth century. A Brazilian historian once referred to colonial life in Brazil as a \"civilization of crabs\", as most settlers clung to the shoreline, with few trying to make inroads into the sert\u00e3o.

The term Vaqueiro is similar to the generic use of \"cowboy\" in the United States. Geographically, the sert\u00e3o consists mainly of low uplands that form part of the Brazilian Highlands. Most parts of the sert\u00e3o are between 200 and 500 meters above sea level, with higher elevations found on the eastern edge in the Planalto da Borborema, where it merges into a sub-humid region known as agreste, in the Serra da Ibiapaba in western Cear\u00e1 and in the Serro do Periquito of central Pernambuco. In the north, the sert\u00e3o extends to the northern coastal plains of Rio Grande do Norte state, whilst in the south it fades out in the northern fringe of Minas Gerais.

Urban flooding can be caused by stormwater runoff, riverine flooding and structural failure when engineered flood management structures, including dams and levees, prove inadequate to manage the quantities and force of flood waters. Floods can also occur when groundwater levels rise entering buildings cracks in foundation, floors and basements.(). Flooding is part of the natural environmental process. Flooding along large river systems is more frequent in spring where peak flows are often governed by runoff volume due to rainfall and snowmelt, but can take place in summer  with flash floods in urban systems that respond to short-duration, heavy rainfall. Flooding due to hurricanes, or downgraded severe storms, is a concern from August to October when tropical storms can affect Eastern North America. Flood events have had a significant effect on various regions of the country. Flooding is the costliest natural disaster for Canadians.

The Classical 12-point wind rose was eventually displaced by the modern compass rose (8-point, 16-point and 32-point), adopted by seafarers during the Middle Ages.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/StuartRevettTower_v2.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Winds", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Meteorology_in_history"], "label": {"value": "Classical compass winds", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_compass_winds?oldid=734001186", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

{"Category": "Flood", "Subject": "Freshet", "abstract": {"value": "The term freshet is most commonly used to describe a spring thaw resulting from snow and ice melt in rivers located in the northern latitudes of North America. A spring freshet can sometimes last several weeks on large river systems, resulting in significant inundation of flood plains as the snow pack melts in the river's catchment area. Freshets occur with generally diminishing strength and duration depending upon the snowpacks having large accumulations and then the local average rates of warming temperatures; late spring melts allowing faster flooding from the relatively longer days and higher solar angle against more southerly latitudes and elevations reaching average melting temperatures sooner where earlier and generally lesser seasonal snow piles melt more gradually spread over a longer melt period. Serious flooding from southern freshets are more often related to rain storms of large tropical weather systems rolling in from the South Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico, to add their powerful heating capacity to lesser snow packs. Tropically induced rainfall influenced quick melts can also affect snow cover to latitudes as far north as southern Canada, so long as the generally colder air mass is not blocking northward movement of low pressure systems. In the eastern part of the continent, annual freshets occur from the Canadian Taiga ranging along both sides of the Great Lakes then down through the heavily forested Appalachian mountain chain and St. Lawrence valley from Northern Maine into barrier ranges in North Carolina and Tennessee. In the western part of the continent, freshets occur throughout the generally much higher elevations of the various west coast mountain ranges that extend southward down from Alaska even into the northern parts of Arizona and New Mexico.

Meteotsunamis are generated when rapid changes in barometric pressure cause the displacement of a body of water. In contrast to \"ordinary\" impulse-type tsunami sources, a traveling atmospheric disturbance normally interacts with the ocean over a limited period of time (from several minutes to several hours). Tsunamis and meteotsunamis are otherwise similar enough that it can be difficult to distinguish one from the other, as in cases where there is a tsunami wave but there are no seismic records of an earthquake. Only about 3% of historical tsunami events (from 2000 BC through 2014) are known to have meteorological origins, although their true prevalence may be considerably higher than this because 10% of historical tsunamis have unknown origins, tsunami events in the past are often difficult to validate, and meteotsunamis may have previously been misclassified as seiche waves. Meteotsunamis are restricted to local effects because they lack the energy available to significant seismic tsunami. However, when they are amplified by resonance they can be hazardous. A meteotsunami that struck Nagasaki Bay on 31 March 1979 achieved a maximum wave height of 5 meters; there were three fatalities. A three-meter wave that hit the Chicago waterfront in 1954 swept people off of piers, drowning seven.

Evidence of this glaciation can be seen in places such as Morocco, Libya, and Wyoming. More evidence derived from isotopic data is that during the Late Ordovician, Tropical ocean temperatures were about 5 \u00b0C cooler than present day, this would have been a major factor that aided in the glaciation process. The Late Ordovician is the only glacial episode that appears to have coincided with a major mass extinction of nearly 61% of marine life.

{"Category": "Ice_ages", "Subject": "Irish_Sea_Glacier", "abstract": {"value": "The Irish Sea Glacier was a huge glacier during the Devensian Ice Age that, probably on more than one occasion, flowed southwards from its source areas in Scotland and Ireland and across the Isle of Man, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire. It was the only clearly defined major glacier in the Irish Sea and flowed about 700 km from its source areas to its southernmost margin. It is sometimes referred to as an \u201cice stream\u201d since it appears to have been constrained not by ice-free land areas but by highlands which were themselves buried beneath ice. At the time of its maximum extent the glacier extended all the way to the coasts of Somerset and Cornwall, along the south coast of Ireland, and even reached the Isles of Scilly. It was forced through a relatively narrow constriction in St George's Channel by ice flowing from the Irish Ice Cap (to the west) and the Welsh Ice Cap (to the east). At one point the glacier was probably no more than 80 km wide. Once through this constriction, the ice spread out into a great lobe, in the area now occupied by the Celtic Sea and the approaches to the Bristol Channel. On the eastern flank of the glacier, the evidence of striations, glacial deposits and \"erratic trains\" shows that the edge of the Irish Sea Glacier was pushed southwards by ice coming from the Welsh ice cap on the Brecon Beacons, so that Irish Sea ice flowed parallel with the coast of South Wales and then came into contact with the English coast around the Somerset Levels, between Exmoor and the Mendips. It is not known how far inland this ice extended, but there are scattered glacial deposits in the Bridgwater - Glastonbury district -- these may mark the easternmost extent of the glacier. On its western flank the Irish Sea Glacier reached Cork Harbour. The maximum width of this great ice lobe was more than 320 km. Currently there is a great debate about the dating of the glaciation of the Isles of Scilly. The ice of the Irish Sea Glacier certainly pressed against the northern coasts of the islands, and accumulating evidence seems to show that this occurred at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) or Late Devensian, some time after 20,000 years ago. During this same glacial episode the ice of the Irish Sea Glacier also swept along the southern Irish coast as far west as Cork, and reached its outer limit about 100 km to the SW of the Isles of Scilly. Research suggests that the ice was everywhere grounded and not floating; this is consistent with the view that sea-level at the LGM was around 130m lower than it is today. Even further out in the southwest approaches, the ice edge was floating and calving. One current theory is that the glacier moved to its outermost position by a \"lobate surge partially propagated by high porewater pressures within deformable marine substrate\", leaving parts of South Wales, the Bristol Channel and the coasts of SW England free of glacier ice. However, glaciers have to behave according to the laws of ice physics, and a long narrow lobate surge with a flat long profile would be difficult to explain. Tightly confined \"valley glaciers\" do not exist on open tundra situations (such as this must have been at the time)especially if the glacier bed rises southwards. Glacier ice in those circumstances must have \"backed up\" and spread sideways. It is most likely that when the Irish Sea Glacier reached its southernmost extent, the glacier surface must have been at c 2,000m in St George\u2019s Channel, c 2,250m over the Isle of Anglesey, and c 2,500m over the Isle of Man. It follows that the mountains of Wales and Eastern Ireland must also have been submerged beneath thick glacier ice at the time. Furthermore, the Bristol Channel is most likely to have been ice-filled at the LGM, as indicated on the adjoining map. Recent work suggests that the area of Older Drift outside the South Ireland End Moraine was inundated by Irish Ice during and after the LGM. At the same time the area of Older Drift on the Welsh side of St George's Channel (outside the South Wales End Moraine) must also have been inundated by ice. However, the glacial deposits relating to this episode of glaciation remain to be discovered. Another puzzle is the extent to which the long profile of the Irish Sea Glacier, at the time of its maximum extent, approximated to the classic equilibrium profile. Work in analogous situations in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica, suggests that the ice surface altitude over the mountains might have been around 800m lower than predicted.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/I_Sea_Glacier2.jpg?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Irish_Sea", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Glaciology", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ice_ages", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Isles_of_Scilly"], "label": {"value": "Irish Sea Glacier", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea_Glacier?oldid=700292793", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": []}

{"Category": "Ice_ages", "Subject": "Cordilleran_Ice_Sheet", "abstract": {"value": "The Cordilleran ice sheet was a major ice sheet that periodically covered large parts of North America during glacial periods over the last ~2.6 million years. This included the following areas: \n* Western Montana \n* The Idaho Panhandle \n* Northern Washington state down to about Olympia and Spokane \n* All of British Columbia \n* The southwestern third or so of Yukon Territory \n* All of the Alaska Panhandle \n* South Central Alaska \n* The Alaska Peninsula \n* Almost all of the continental shelf north of the Strait of Juan de Fuca The ice sheet covered up to 2.5 million square kilometres at the Last Glacial Maximum and probably more than that in some previous periods, when it may have extended into the northeast extremity of Oregon and the Salmon River Mountains in Idaho. It is probable, though, that its northern margin also migrated south due to the influence of starvation caused by very low levels of precipitation. At its eastern end the Cordilleran ice sheet merged with the Laurentide ice sheet at the Continental Divide, forming an area of ice that contained one and a half times as much water as the Antarctic ice sheet does today. At its western end it is believed nowadays that several small glacial refugia existed during the last glacial maximum below present sea level in the now-submerged Hecate Strait and on the Brooks Peninsula in northern Vancouver Island. However, evidence of ice-free refugia above present sea level north of the Olympic Peninsula has been refuted by genetic and geological studies since the middle 1990s. The ice sheet faded north of the Alaska Range because the climate was too dry to form glaciers. Unlike the Laurentide ice sheet, which is believed to have taken as much as eleven thousand years to fully melt, it is believed the Cordilleran ice sheet, except for areas that remain glaciated today, melted very quickly, probably in four thousand years or less. This rapid melting caused such floods as the overflow of Lake Missoula and shaped the topography of the extremely fertile Inland Empire of Eastern Washington.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Map_missoula_floods.gif?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Glaciology_of_the_United_States", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Geology_of_Washington_(state)", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Geology_of_Montana", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Geology_of_Idaho", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ice_sheets", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ice_ages", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Geology_of_Yukon", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Geology_of_Alberta", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Geology_of_Alaska", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Glaciology_of_Canada", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Geology_of_British_Columbia"], "label": {"value": "Cordilleran Ice Sheet", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordilleran_Ice_Sheet?oldid=710067035", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordilleran_ice_sheet", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Puget_Lobe"]}

{"Category": "Ice_ages", "Subject": "Champlain_Sea", "abstract": {"value": "The Champlain Sea was a temporary inlet of the Atlantic Ocean, created by the retreating glaciers during the close of the last ice age. The Sea once included lands in what are now the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, as well as parts of the American states of New York and Vermont. The mass of ice from the continental ice sheets had depressed the rock beneath it over millennia. At the end of the last ice age, while the rock was still depressed, the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa River valleys, as well as modern Lake Champlain, were below sea level and flooded with rising worldwide sea levels, once the ice no longer prevented the ocean from flowing into the region. As the land gradually rose again, in the process known as isostatic rebound, the sea coast gradually retreated to its current location. The sea lasted from about 13,000 years ago to about 10,000 years ago and was continuously shrinking during that time, since the rebounding continent was slowly rising above sea level. At its peak, the sea extended inland as far south as Lake Champlain and somewhat farther west than the city of Ottawa, Ontario, and farther up the Ottawa River past Pembroke. The remaining glaciers fed the sea during that time, making it more brackish than typical seawater. It is estimated that the sea was as much as 150 metres (490 ft) above the level of today's Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers. The best evidence of this former sea is the vast clay plain deposited along the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers. This resulted in distinctive forest types, and large wetlands. Other modern evidence of the sea can be seen in the form of whale fossils, (belugas, fin whales, and bowhead whales) and marine shells that have been found near the cities of Ottawa, Ontario, and Montreal, Quebec. There are also fossils of oceanic fish such as capelin. The Sea also left  ancient raised shorelines in the former coastal regions, and the Leda clay deposits in areas of deeper water. The northern shore of the lake was in southern Quebec where outcrops of the Canadian shield form the Eardley Escarpment. This escarpment still has distinctive plants that may date back to the sea. The Eardley Escarpment is known locally as the Gatineau Hills; part of the Mattawa fault at the southeastern edge of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, in Eastern Ontario and the Outaouais region of Quebec, more commonly known as the Ottawa Valley.", "lang": 1}, "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Champlain_Sea.png?width=300", "subjects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Ice_ages", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Seas_of_the_Atlantic_Ocean", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Climate_history", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Lake_Champlain", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Natural_history_of_Quebec", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Natural_history_of_Vermont", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Pleistocene", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Glacial_lakes_of_the_United_States", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Natural_history_of_New_York", "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Natural_history_of_Ontario"], "label": {"value": "Champlain Sea", "lang": 1}, "wiki": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champlain_Sea?oldid=737972972", "wikiPageDisambiguates": "", "wikiPageRedirects": ["http://dbpedia.org/resource/Champlain_sea"]}

It is named after the East Anglian town of Cromer in England where interglacial deposits that accumulated during part of this stage were first discovered. The stratotype for this interglacial is the 'Cromer Forest Bed' situated at the bottom of the coastal cliff near West Runton (East Anglia). The 'British' Cromerian with the rank of a stage forms part of the superstage that is known as the Cromerian Complex in Europe. In Central Europe, the Cromerian Complex (Cromer-Komplex) is divided into three glacials and four interglacials, which are equivalent to Marine Isotope stages 13 to 21. In the Alpine region it may also be referred to as the G\u00fcnz-Mindel interglacial, the warm period between the G\u00fcnz and Mindel glaciations. In Britain, sediments deposited during the Cromerian (s.s.) precede those of the Anglian Stage and are on top of Beestonian Stage sediments. In the British isles several interglacials of 'Cromerian affinity' are known from this timeframe, one of these is the type Cromerian. Opinions of the exact correlation of British and continental Cromerian differ. Based upon the beginning of Marine Isotope Stage 21 and the end of Marine Isotope Stage 13, the Cromerian Complex started 866,000 years ago and ended 478,000 years ago. The Cromerian (s.s.) had been equated to the Aftonian in North America. However, the Aftonian, along with the Yarmouthian (Yarmouth), Kansan, and Nebraskan, have been abandoned by North American Quaternary geologists and merged into the Pre-Illinoian. At this time, the Cromerian is correlated with the period of time, which includes the Pre-Illinoian C, Pre-Illinoian D, and Pre-Illinoian E glaciations of North America. Proposals for structuring the Cromerium complex have become quite confusing. Great potential for a full breakdown has been provided by the extensive, continental series at Gorleben. In 1990 a mammoth skeleton was found at West Runton; the best example of the species Mammuthus trogontherii to be unearthed so far. A significant fossil site, with animal remains dating to the Cromer Complex, is the Mosbach Sands, named after an abandoned village near Wiesbaden.
